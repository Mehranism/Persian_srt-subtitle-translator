00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,230
DAVID MALAN: All right.

4
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,130
This is CS50, Harvard
University's Introduction

5
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,590
to the Intellectual
Enterprises of Computer Science

6
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,310
and the Art of Programming.

7
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,940
My name is David Malan, and I actually
took this class myself some years ago,

8
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,080
but I almost didn't.

9
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,590
It was my first year in
college and my roommates

10
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,150
and I were living in Matthews
Hall, for those familiar.

11
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,195
[CHEERING]

12
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,840
Nice, Matthews.

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,080
Our claim to fame, actually, at the
time was that our room was literally

14
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,310
Matt Damon's just three years' prior.

15
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,440
So onward from that.

16
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,190
But my first year, I didn't
really have the nerves

17
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,410
to set foot in this classroom,
let alone computer science.

18
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,340
In fact, for me, computer
science, and CS50 in particular,

19
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,750
was very much this class to beware.

20
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,090
Like, I was kind of
comfortable with computers,

21
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,660
but I certainly wasn't among those
more comfortable with computers.

22
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,550
And so I shied away my first year.

23
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,310
Instead, I actually took a whole
lot of classes in government.

24
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,889
In fact, in high school, I
was really enjoying history.

25
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,890
I loved this constitutional
law class that I

26
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,520
took my senior year of high school.

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,978
And so I figured, OK, if that's
what I liked in high school

28
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:18,110
and if that's where my
comfort zone was, that's

29
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,370
probably what I should
be doing in college.

30
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,480
And so I essentially declared as my
concentration or major government

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,680
for the first year, year
and a half of school.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,010
But my sophomore year when I was living
actually in Mather House instead.

33
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,570
OK, no one from Mather.

34
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,540
In Mather House instead, it was--

35
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,090
I sort of followed some
friends, I think the first week

36
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,790
of class in September of that
year to a class called CS50.

37
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,625
And honestly, once I stepped
foot in that classroom,

38
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,000
the professor at the time was
a famous computer scientist

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,980
by the name of Brian
Kernighan, now at Princeton.

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,090
Like, I was hooked.

41
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,100
And literally would I go back thereafter
on Friday evenings when, at the time,

42
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,830
problem sets were released
and sit down at 7:00,

43
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,510
8:00 PM on Friday nights
and dive into homework.

44
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,180
Which isn't necessarily
something we recommend, per se.

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,920
But for me, it was like this sign that,
wow, I've sort of found my calling.

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,108
I found my classmates here on campus.

47
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,150
And that's not going to
be the case for everyone.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,470
Certainly, we have no expectations that
after taking one computer science class

49
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,760
that you will or might
want to take others.

50
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,840
But what's so empowering about
computer science and CS50

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,660
in particular is it's so
applicable to the broader world,

52
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,160
whether you're in the arts, humanities,
social sciences, natural sciences,

53
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,780
or beyond, it's just so applicable the
concepts and the practical programming

54
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,090
skills with which you will
exit a class like this.

55
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,830
Now it's going to be challenging along
the way, and indeed, I put in my time

56
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,210
back in the day, and even
I did find it challenging.

57
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,750
And here, for instance, is a
photograph of a very famous MIT hack,

58
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,410
so to speak, from down the
road, whereby it communicates

59
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,010
that getting an education from MIT is
like trying to drink from a fire hose.

60
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,600
Which is to say there's going to be so
much information, like so much new stuff

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,620
that certainly on any
given day of the week,

62
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,760
you're not going to be able to absorb
all of it that first time around.

63
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,530
But at the end of the day, it's through
that challenge, putting the time in,

64
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,862
that the returns are therefore just so
much higher at the end of the course.

65
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:14,070
And indeed, will you walk out of the
course with a much better understanding,

66
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,945
not only of computer
science and programming,

67
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:20,640
but ultimately how to teach yourself
new technologies and beyond.

68
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,250
For the next three plus months,
will we have teaching fellows,

69
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,180
teaching assistants, course
assistants, and myself by your side

70
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,990
guiding you through
the course's material.

71
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,210
But the goal by term's end is to take
those and leave those training wheels

72
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,170
off so that you're well-equipped
to go teach yourself

73
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,410
new ideas beyond the class itself.

74
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,800
Take comfort, though, in knowing
that most CS50 students have never

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,530
taken a CS course before, and
indeed, as per the syllabus,

76
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,327
what ultimately matters in this
course is not so much where

77
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,660
you end up relative to your
classmates but where you end

78
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,210
up relative to yourself when you began.

79
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,560
And when you began is thus today.

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,280
And so consider just how
comfortable or uncomfortable

81
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,290
you are with computing, let alone
computer science and programming,

82
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,950
particularly if you've never explored
either in a classroom before,

83
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,540
and consider the delta just a few
months from now that will really

84
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,350
describe how far you have come.

85
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,620
And that is all that
matters, not how much

86
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,270
the student to the left or the right,
in front or behind you right now, knows.

87
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,360
With that said, let me add some
additional inspiration, if I may.

88
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,130
Here's a photograph of my own very first
homework assignment in CS50 from 1996,

89
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,880
and I will draw your
attention to the fact

90
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,270
that even though this is a so-called
hello world program that we'll

91
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,290
play with ourselves next week, it is
pretty much literally the shortest,

92
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,980
easiest program you can write in
a programming language called C.

93
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,900
I still somehow got minus
2 on my very first homework

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,090
assignment, which is to say, we're all
going to make mistakes along the way.

95
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,570
But the goal will be to learn and
enjoy that process here on out.

96
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,670
At the end of the day,
too, like me, you'll

97
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,250
exit with your own
proudly held high took

98
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,080
CS50 t-shirt as is our tradition too.

99
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,530
With that said, there are so many
other traditions within CS50,

100
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,760
both on campus and off.

101
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,440
And in particular, do we try in CS50 to
provide not only the academic support

102
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,690
structure that you might
want going through the class,

103
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,990
but also a collective
shared community experience.

104
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,830
Which is to say in just a few days
we'll start off the term formally

105
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,320
with CS50 Puzzle Day, which
is not only an opportunity

106
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,230
to get together with friends,
with pizza and prizes

107
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,980
and also logic puzzles of sorts, but
really to send the message that computer

108
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,570
science itself is not about
programming, it's not about C,

109
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,810
it's not about Python, it's not
about programming languages per se,

110
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,000
but about problem solving, ever more so
collaboratively with other smart people

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,620
by your side in this class or beyond.

112
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,210
And indeed, are there, toward the
end of the semester, reinforcements

113
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,930
of the same by way of a little something
that we call the CS50 Hackathon, which

114
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,780
will be an opportunity overnight to
dive into your own final projects,

115
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,440
the capstone of this course,
thereafter followed by the CS50 fair,

116
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,020
which will be a campus wide
exhibition for students, faculty,

117
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,660
and staff across campus of your very own
final projects, be it your very own web

118
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,170
app or mobile app or anything else
you decide to create by term's end.

119
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,980
And indeed, the objective
at the end of the day,

120
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,190
truly with that final
project in particular,

121
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,480
is going to be to create for
yourselves, for your classmates,

122
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,590
for attendees, something that we
didn't even teach you how to do.

123
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,970
And indeed, that will signal ultimately
that you're indeed on your way

124
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,170
and ready.

125
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,258
Toward that end, thought we would
give you a sense of CS50's past

126
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:31,050
by way of this short
video, if we could dim

127
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,591
the lights, that paints a picture
of all that awaits here and beyond.

[END PLAYBACK]

132
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,400
DAVID MALAN: All right, so welcome
aboard to CS50 and computer science

133
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,900
itself.

134
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,280
So what is computer science?

135
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,980
Well, put simply, it's
the study of information.

136
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,563
Like, how do you represent
it and how do you process it.

137
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:47,980
But more fundamentally, what
we'll teach you in this class

138
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,490
is computational thinking.

139
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,780
That is to say, the application
of ideas from computer science

140
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,710
to problems of interest to us within the
class and problems of interest to you

141
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,830
after the class.

142
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,730
And so at the end of the day,
what computer science really

143
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,940
is is about problem solving, ergo
that sort of global applicability.

144
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,850
And by problem solving, we
mean something quite simple.

145
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,550
In fact, we can distill it as
follows with this mental image.

146
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,080
This is problem solving.

147
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,830
You've got some problem to
solve, thus known as the input

148
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,890
that you want to solve.

149
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,740
And the goal, of course,
to problem solving

150
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,580
is to actually produce a solution.

151
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,030
So the output in this model
would be the solution.

152
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,620
The interesting part ultimately is going
to be in how you process that input

153
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,320
and turn it into that output,
ergo solving problems.

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,680
But before we can do that, we all
kind of have to agree how to represent

155
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,810
sent these inputs and
outputs, especially

156
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,750
if we want to do it in a standardized
global way using literally computers,

157
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,560
be them laptops, desktops,
phones, or most any other kind

158
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,460
of electronic device nowadays.

159
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,840
So how can we do that?

160
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,690
Well, there's different ways to
represent information in the world.

161
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,680
For instance, if I were to take
attendance old school style, maybe

162
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,890
in a smaller room, I might
do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

163
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,800
and so forth and just count
people on my human hands.

164
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,330
That's actually known as unary
notation, otherwise mathematically known

165
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,600
as base one, because you're
using your fingers literally

166
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
in this model as digits.

167
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,880
But a little quick question.

168
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,680
How high can you count
with one human hand?

169
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,510
Five is incorrect if you use a
different base system than one.

170
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,380
So it's obviously correct if you're just
using unary and just counting 1, 2, 3,

171
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,280
4, 5.

172
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,830
But I dare say I can come up with
more patterns in my human hand

173
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,490
alone that would enable me, without
a second hand or a couple of feet,

174
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,360
to count higher than five.

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,520
In fact, maybe for
those more comfortable,

176
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,950
how high could you actually count
on a single human hand, perhaps?

177
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,130
So 31, believe it or not, is,
in fact, the correct answer.

178
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,840
But why?

179
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,270
Well, here I initially
started pretty naively.

180
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

181
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,477
And I just combined all of my fingers
and counted the collective total.

182
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,560
But what if I'm a little
more clever and take into

183
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,520
account the pattern
of fingers that go up.

184
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,020
So maybe this is still zero.

185
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,460
This is one.

186
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,870
But now maybe we just agree
universally that this is two.

187
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,000
Even though it's just my
single pointer finger.

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,990
Maybe we all just agree that this
is three with two fingers up.

189
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,740
Maybe we agree that this is
often offensive with just one

190
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,630
middle finger up, but
this would then be four.

191
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,370
This could then be five.

192
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,020
This could then be six.

193
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,370
This could be seven.

194
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,700
And if I keep permuting my fingers
in this way-- allow me to spoil it--

195
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,670
this would be, in fact, 31.

196
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,960
But again, why?

197
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,190
But the difference here is that
we're no longer using unary or base

198
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,440
one as a mathematician would
say, but rather base two.

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,190
Because if we take into account
not just the total number

200
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,380
of fingers that I'm using, but whether
each finger is down or up being

201
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,580
therefore in two potential states.

202
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,240
Down, up, A, B, black,
white, however you

203
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,100
want to distinguish those
two states of the world,

204
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,390
you're now operating what's called
base two, and perhaps more familiarly,

205
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:58,020
even if you're not a computer person per
se, this is the so-called binary system.

206
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,140
And odds are, even if you're not
a computer science person at all,

207
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,370
you probably generally know that
computers only understand or speak

208
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,310
what alphabet, so to speak?

209
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,680
So ones and zeros, zeros and ones,
otherwise known as the binary system.

210
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,180
And in fact, there's a term of
art here that's worth noting.

211
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,540
When you're using zeros and ones, which,
of course, are a total of two digits,

212
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,930
you have binary digits, so
to speak-- bi implying two,

213
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,330
which means there's two
possibilities, zero or one.

214
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,990
If we actually get rid of some of these
letters and then join these two phrases,

215
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,365
here you have a technical
term that is a bit.

216
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:35,220
A bit is just a binary digit,
which is to say it's a zero or one.

217
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,090
And this is in contrast,
of course, with the system

218
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,340
you and I know as the decimal system.

219
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,770
Dec implying 10, because
in the real world

220
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,530
you and I daily use zero through
nine, which is 10 possibilities.

221
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,090
Computers only use zero and
one, that is to say two bits,

222
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,170
to represent information instead.

223
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,980
So how do we represent this
information, especially when at the end

224
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,250
of the day what we're using are indeed
computers and electronic devices?

225
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,130
Well, if I want to represent zero, I
can actually think of this as analogous

226
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,190
to the physical world.

227
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,600
Maybe I have a light bulb
that's off or on controlled

228
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,800
by a switch that turns it off or on.

229
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,110
So you can think of a binary
digit that is a zero as really

230
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,220
just being a light bulb that is off.

231
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,350
By contrast, if you think of a one
in the digital world as, of course,

232
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,140
being the second of
two possibilities, you

233
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,870
can think of that in the human or
analog world, the physical world,

234
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,030
as being a light bulb that is on.

235
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,210
And in fact, what's inside of your
Mac, your PC, your Android phone,

236
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,360
your iPhone are millions of
tiny little light switches

237
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,080
known as transistors that just can
be turned on or off, on or off.

238
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,710
And essentially, you can use those
transistors to store information

239
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,710
because if you want to store a zero,
you turn one of those switches off.

240
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,920
If you want to store a one, you
turn one of those switches on.

241
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,440
Of course, that sort of
invites the question, well,

242
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,370
how do we count higher than zero or one?

243
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,490
Well, we would seem to
need to use more than just

244
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,080
maybe a single bit, a single light bulb.

245
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,800
So if we wanted to count higher
than, for instance, zero or one,

246
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,900
why don't we go ahead and maybe do this?

247
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,030
So just so I have some
place to put these,

248
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,390
let me borrow some of our
actual physical light bulbs

249
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,560
here from the stage.

250
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,680
And let me propose that now, with three
bits on the stage, three light switches,

251
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,790
three transistors, whatever metaphor
you're most comfortable with, this

252
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,210
is how a computer would represent a
zero, because all of them are off.

253
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,240
So it's off, off, off.

254
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,550
But if a computer wanted to count
to one, we could do naively this.

255
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,650
We could turn this on.

256
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,320
If the computer wanted to turn
represent two, we could do this.

257
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,400
And if a computer wanted to
represent three, we could do this.

258
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,090
But I'm kind of painting
myself into a corner

259
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,720
and not using these light
bulbs as cleverly as I could,

260
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,250
because at the moment I've
only counted as high as three.

261
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,470
So if I want to count to
four, to five, to six,

262
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,330
I'm going to need more
and more light bulbs.

263
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,770
Can we be a little more clever?

264
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,150
Well, again, someone else who's
among those more comfortable, what's

265
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,060
the spoiler here?

266
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,070
How high using binary
zeros and ones could I

267
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,740
count with three light bulbs total?

268
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,590
In back?

269
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah.

270
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,798
So seven here is the answer.

271
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,590
And if that, too, you're
sort of wondering,

272
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,730
how are people figuring out 31 and 7?

273
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,200
That's the goal at hand here.

274
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,250
So let me do this.

275
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,950
Let me turn all of these off again so
that my three light bulbs or switches

276
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,490
again represent zero.

277
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,690
And the first one's easy.

278
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,450
This is how a computer would
represent the number one.

279
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,630
It would be on, off, off.

280
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,000
How, though, is a computer
going to represent two?

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,490
Well, just like my
proposed finger example.

282
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,270
Let's do this.

283
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,470
Let's turn this one off and this one on.

284
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,720
That is how a computer
would represent two.

285
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,670
By saying off, on, off.

286
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,540
In other words, 010 would be the
way to pronounce it digitally.

287
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,460
What if I instead want
to represent three?

288
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,980
That's how on my finger I
did this, with two fingers.

289
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,840
Well, I'm going to turn this one on.

290
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,010
This is three.

291
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,980
Now, this will, for those less
comfortable, be non-obvious.

292
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,190
This now is how I would
represent the number four.

293
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,200
This is how I would represent five.

294
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,860
This is how I would represent six.

295
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,090
And this, as per the spoiler,
is how I would represent seven.

296
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,560
So perhaps very non-obvious
what it was I just did

297
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,400
or why I chose those patterns.

298
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,570
But I dare say if you rewind in your
mind's eye or literally later on video,

299
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,910
you'll find that I actually did show you
eight distinct patterns of light bulbs.

300
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,440
The first one was off, off, off.

301
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,150
The last one was, on, on, on.

302
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,840
And there were another
six total in between then.

303
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,170
Well, wait, why seven?

304
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,980
Well, if you start counting at zero and
I claim there's eight possibilities,

305
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,250
you can only count from zero
to seven, as we will soon see.

306
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,000
So how are these patterns
coming about and what is it

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,930
that our computers are actually doing?

308
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,280
Well, it's actually doing something a
little like this, quite like in decimal.

309
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,070
So in the human world,
you and I are very

310
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,700
much in the habit of using base
10, zero through nine, a.k.a.

311
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,490
Decimal.

312
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,089
Well, how do we use it
instinctively as humans?

313
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,230
Well, what's this number
obviously on the screen?

314
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,490
123.

315
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,369
But why is it 123?

316
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,119
Like, for years you
haven't really thought

317
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,150
about why this pattern of
symbols or digits on the screen,

318
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,650
one, two, three, represents
mathematically this number

319
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,940
that you know obviously as 123.

320
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,400
But if you rewind to
grade school, odds are,

321
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,820
like me, you were taught that the
rightmost digit is in the ones column,

322
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,840
this second digit is in the tens column,
this digit is in the hundreds column,

323
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,650
and so forth.

324
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,590
So even though none of us have
to do this math explicitly,

325
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,910
what you're instantly doing
is 100 times 1 plus 10 times

326
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,410
2 plus 1 times 3, which
gives you 100 plus 20 plus 3.

327
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:50,590
Oh, that's why it is 123, because
these digits in this order

328
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,490
have that significance.

329
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,740
The digits to the left have
more weight, so to speak,

330
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,570
than the digits to the right.

331
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,610
So what can we take away from this?

332
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,607
Well, let's generalize it first
as just any three digit number.

333
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:02,690
So number, number, number.

334
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,530
The ones column, the tens
column, the hundreds column.

335
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,780
But there's some math going on there,
and it's not particularly sophisticated.

336
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,910
Those are actually powers of 10.

337
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:16,610
So 10 to the 0, 10 to the 1, 10 to the
2, and there's your decimal system.

338
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,020
Because the base in this
value is a 10, that's

339
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,870
because there's 10 possibilities
for each of those placeholders,

340
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,310
zero through nine.

341
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,510
But in the binary world, in the
world of computers where all they

342
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,080
have are zeros and ones, why?

343
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,450
Because all they have
physically is transistors.

344
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,180
Tiny, tiny, tiny light
bulbs that can be off or on.

345
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,860
If you only have two
digits to play with,

346
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,160
the 10 base should, of
course, become a two base.

347
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,570
And now if we do some math here, 2
to the 0, 2 to the 1, and 2 to the 2,

348
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,440
you get the ones column, the
twos column, the fours column.

349
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,750
And if we keep going 8, 16,
32, 64, 128 and so forth,

350
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,760
its powers of 2 instead of powers of 10.

351
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,080
But this is to say computers
represent information

352
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,600
in exactly the same way you
and I have since childhood,

353
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,330
but they have fewer
digits at their disposal,

354
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,000
so these columns need to
be weighted differently.

355
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,900
So we can still count from zero
all the way up toward infinity.

356
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,400
So what does this mean?

357
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,630
Well, here we have three
bits on the screen, 000.

358
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,680
If we were to convert this now
mentally or on paper pencil to decimal,

359
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,670
how do we do it?

360
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,820
Well, 4 times 0 plus 2
times 0 plus 1 times 0.

361
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,670
That gives us the mathematical
number you and I know as zero.

362
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,470
That was three light bulbs.

363
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,140
Off, off, off.

364
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,770
Well, what if we turn on one light
bulb all the way on the right?

365
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,790
What decimal number does this
binary number, 001 represent?

366
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,512
Just one, because it's 4
times 0, 2 times 0, 1 times 1.

367
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:48,220
Here's where things
got more interesting,

368
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,970
even if non-obvious in light bulb
form or even physical hand form.

369
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:55,630
010 in binary is what in decimal?

370
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,310
Two, because it's 2
times 1 and that's it.

371
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,270
011 in binary is, of course now three.

372
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,890
This is now four.

373
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,210
This is now five.

374
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,910
This is now six and seven.

375
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:11,970
On, on, on or 111 is the highest
we can count with these three bits.

376
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,470
All right.

377
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,120
So how might a computer
intuitively count as high as eight?

378
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,613
What do you need to do, presumably?

379
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,030
You're going to need to add a bit.

380
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,100
So you need another light
bulb, another switch.

381
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,650
You need more memory, so to
speak, to use nomenclature

382
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,150
with which you're probably familiar.

383
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,670
So in fact, if we change
all of those to zero

384
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,460
but we give ourself one more
bit for a total of four,

385
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,710
that's got to be the eighth
place because there's just

386
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,890
another power of two.

387
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,700
So 1000 is the decimal number eight.

388
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,680
You don't say 1,000 in binary.

389
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,990
You literally say 1000.

390
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,063
But that is the number
you and I know as eight.

391
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:46,730
And you can keep going up and up and up.

392
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:51,140
And how then computers with Excel or
any kind of number crunching software

393
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,180
count really high and keep
track of really big numbers?

394
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,040
The computer just throws more and
more transistors at it, more and more

395
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,680
bits to count higher and
higher and higher than this.

396
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,480
It turns out, though, one bit,
three bits, even four bits

397
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,660
aren't that useful in practice
because literally you can count

398
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,420
as high as seven or maybe 15 or 31.

399
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:18,620
So more commonly, as is commonly known,
is to use a byte of bits instead.

400
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,270
How many bits is in a
byte, for those familiar?

401
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,080
So it's just eight.

402
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,710
Why eight?

403
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,760
It's just more useful than one or
two or three or some other number.

404
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,150
And as an aside, it happens
to be a power of two, which

405
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,350
is just useful electronically as well.

406
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,570
So a byte then is just 8 bits.

407
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,900
And here are those columns I
rattled off off the top of my head.

408
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,320
Here is how a computer would
represent zero in decimal,

409
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,510
but using eight binary digits or bits.

410
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,460
Little trivia.

411
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,710
And again, this is not what
computer science is about,

412
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,640
but it helps to know the lower
bounds and the upper bounds

413
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,030
of these kinds of values.

414
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:57,760
How high can you count with 8
bits or 1 byte if this is zero?

415
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,390
Yeah.

416
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,560
So it's actually 255.

417
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,830
So if I were to change
all of these zeros to ones

418
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,420
and then do some quick mental
or calculator math, 128 plus 64

419
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,390
plus 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1
would actually give me 255 total.

420
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:18,110
Plus 0, which gives me
256 total possibilities.

421
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,100
So this is only to say-- this
is not, again, the kind of math

422
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,080
will frequently do,
but you'll commonly see

423
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,410
in the computer world and
programming world powers of two,

424
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,730
numbers like 255, 256.

425
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,230
Why?

426
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,150
Because these are the common units
of measures that systems tend to use.

427
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,410
So let me pause here and see,
with respect to binary, zeros,

428
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:46,408
and ones, transistors and the like, any
questions or confusion we can clear up?

429
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,450
Oh, really good question.

430
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:54,310
Why are bits just on or off instead
of maybe sort of 0%, 50%, 100%

431
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,460
by playing with voltages?

432
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,430
So the voltage inference of
yours is actually correct.

433
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,020
That's what computers typically do.

434
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:07,480
Maybe they use 0-ish volts to represent
0, maybe 5-ish volts to represent 1.

435
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,140
It turns out it's just really
easy to do extremes in computers.

436
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,200
If you start to split that
range of voltage levels,

437
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,280
for those who remember
any of their electricity,

438
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,410
it just gets harder
and harder to be exact.

439
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,390
And if you get things
a little too murky,

440
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,160
you might mistake a zero for
a one or a two or a three.

441
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,650
So it turns out it's just
simpler to use the binary system.

442
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,360
But there do exist computers known
as ternary computers that actually

443
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,570
use three values, zero, one, and
two, which is somewhere, of course,

444
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,757
between binary and decimal.

445
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:38,090
But you can do different things.

446
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,350
It's just simple on and off.

447
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,600
In case in point, I don't want to really
be dramatic and turn off my computer,

448
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,340
but if I pulled out the power plug,
that could be off, literally, a.k.a.

449
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,950
zero.

450
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,510
Plug it back in, that's a one.

451
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,100
There's just a cleanliness
and simplicity to that.

452
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,680
Other questions or confusion
that we can clear up?

453
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,220
No?

454
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,310
OK.

455
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,620
So if you're in agreement for the moment
that, OK, using just zeros and ones,

456
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,120
we can represent any number
we want from zero on up, let

457
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,270
me propose that we do more useful things
with our computers and our pockets

458
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,210
and desktops and laps
like represent letters,

459
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,470
for the sake of Google Docs,
Microsoft Word, or any kind of text

460
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,130
that we might want to write.

461
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,590
So knowing now that computers only
contain or only use zeros and ones,

462
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,080
and therefore only contain
hardware like transistors,

463
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,980
how could you represent
something like a capital letter

464
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,050
A in English inside of a computer?

465
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,262
Which, of course, is
not a number anymore.

466
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:38,220
Like, what could we do?

467
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,720
Yeah?

468
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,095
AUDIENCE: We could use the
alphabet and then use numbers.

469
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:42,012
DAVID MALAN: OK, yeah.

470
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:44,470
So we could take the alphabet
A through Z in English

471
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,670
and we could just assign
each letter A number.

472
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,860
And honestly, that is not
only the correct answer,

473
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,172
it's really the only answer.

474
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:51,880
Because at the end of
the day, if all you

475
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,560
have are zeros and
ones available to you,

476
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,540
that is the entirety of the
potential solution to this problem.

477
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,830
So it turns out that, yes,
capital letter A, some years ago,

478
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,190
was decided by a bunch of people
in a room shall be represented

479
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,260
with this pattern of zeros and ones.

480
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,920
01000001.

481
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,740
And now, trained as you are
to do a bit of quick binary

482
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,090
math, what decimal number is used
to represent apparently capital A?

483
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,140
So 65, because that's 64
plus 1 plus 1 times 1 is 65.

484
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,890
What is B?

485
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,060
Turns out it's 66.

486
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,570
What is C?

487
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,310
67.

488
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,390
So they kept things simple there on out.

489
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,900
Might have been nice if A
were zero or maybe a were one.

490
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,940
But nope, we're stuck with 65 instead.

491
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,820
But everything after that
is very much predictable.

492
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,880
And in fact, for
lowercase letters, there's

493
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,110
a whole other set of numbers such
as lowercase A happens to be 97,

494
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,840
lowercase B happens to
be 98, and so forth.

495
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,910
But again, this is like CS trivia.

496
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,530
But what's important here is that
there are indeed contiguous from 65

497
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,910
to 66 to 67 on up.

498
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,750
That's something we're going to be able
to leverage beyond the letter A alone.

499
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,762
What is this system?

500
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,720
What is this mapping that
you yourself propose?

501
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,840
It's ASCII, the American Standard
Code for Information Interchange.

502
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,680
And indeed, it was a bunch of Americans
years ago who came up with this system.

503
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:17,360
Unfortunately, at the time, they only
allocated 7 and eventually 8 bits total

504
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,860
for representing letters, both
uppercase and lowercase, numbers

505
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,540
on the keyboard as well,
punctuation symbols as well.

506
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,100
And so per our conversation a moment
ago, if the Americans in this room,

507
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,130
so to speak, only used 8 bits total,
how many different characters can we

508
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,760
represent with a computer in this story?

509
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,140
So only 255, technically 256 if we,
again, start counting from zero.

510
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,340
So that's not nearly enough to
represent all human languages,

511
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,940
but it is enough to represent at
least English, among some others.

512
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,000
So here, for instance, is a
chart of the ASCII mapping.

513
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,010
And sure enough, if we zoom in on
this column here, 65 is capital A,

514
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:03,890
66 is capital B, dot, dot, dot
72 is H, 73 is I, and so forth.

515
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,010
So there is a standardized mapping for
at least all of these English letters.

516
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,870
Well, suppose you were to receive
an email or a text message

517
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,930
or like a Google Doc containing
this pattern of zeros and ones.

518
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:20,310
So 01001000 and so forth and so forth.

519
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,100
So 3 bytes worth.

520
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,060
Three sets of 8 bits.

521
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:30,650
That is to say 3 bytes, each of which
represents a single letter in ASCII.

522
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,092
What message have you received?

523
00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:35,300
Well, I'll do the math this
time so we don't have to.

524
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,940
Suppose what you really
received was decimal 72, 73, 33.

525
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,000
What message did you just receive?

526
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,100
If you recall the previous chart.

527
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,910
Hi was in fact correct.

528
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,410
Why?

529
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,790
Because H is 72, I is 73.

530
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,950
And wait a minute, 33.

531
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,420
So here's H. Here's I. 33,
if we highlight it instead,

532
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,260
happens to be an exclamation point.

533
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,980
So that is literally what is going
on underneath the hood, so to speak,

534
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,850
when you get a text message today
that literally says in all caps

535
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,810
and an exclamation point, HI!

536
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,400
Your phone has received at
least three bytes, each of which

537
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,143
represents a letter of the alphabet.

538
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:14,060
Your computer is quickly
doing the mental math

539
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,430
to figure out exactly what
numbers those are and then

540
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,970
looking up in the so-called ASCII
chart in its memories, in some sense,

541
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,630
what letter should you actually
see on the screen there.

542
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,910
And so if you were to
then display that message,

543
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:33,920
you would see it indeed in English as
opposed to those numeric equivalents.

544
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,170
How else might we use this then?

545
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,540
Well, here again is that chart.

546
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,880
And maybe just to vary things, maybe
take a little pressure off of me

547
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,100
here, why don't we try
spelling something else?

548
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,050
This time a different three letter
word, but maybe eight volunteers.

549
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,800
Could we get a bytes'
worth of volunteers?

550
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,840
And I can sweeten the deal with
some stress balls in exchange.

551
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,480
You just have to be comfortable coming
up on stage and being on the internet.

552
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:54,980
So yes.

553
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,490
One, two.

554
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,080
How about three, four.

555
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,050
How about five, six, seven.

556
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,250
And how about eight.

557
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,120
Come on up.

558
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,040
A round of applause for our volunteers.

559
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,678
Yep.

560
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:08,018
[APPLAUSE]

561
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:11,770


562
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,288
All right.

563
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:14,080
So what I'm going to
have each of you do is

564
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,300
represent a bit in a particular order.

565
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,360
So if you want to just,
in any order, line

566
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,380
yourselves up here facing the audience.

567
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,860
Come on over.

568
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,562
All right.

569
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,520
And we will have you represent--
well, we got to see who ends up where.

570
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,050
Scooch this way a little bit.

571
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,660
This way, this way.

572
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,160
All right.

573
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,700
So you shall be the ones place and
just hold that in front of you.

574
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,460
Twos place.

575
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,510
Threes.

576
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,010
Fours place.

577
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,720
Eights place.

578
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,940
16, 32, 64, and 128.

579
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,430
And just compress yourselves
a little bit if you could.

580
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,780
So each of these folks represents
a bit in a particular place.

581
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,650
And let's say this.

582
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,770
If you're just standing there
uncomfortably without any hand raise,

583
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,380
we'll assume that you're
representing a zero, quite simply.

584
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,230
If your hand goes up,
though, the audience

585
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,280
should assume that you're
representing a one.

586
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,863
And therefore, what we'll do is
spell out a three letter word,

587
00:30:06,863 --> 00:30:10,190
and on each round of this, you'll
either stay, stay like this,

588
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,730
or you'll raise your hand.

589
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,330
But first, let's actually
meet some of our volunteers

590
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,180
here, starting with position number
one, if you'd like to say your name,

591
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,010
perhaps where you're
from and/or studying.

592
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

593
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,630
My name is Brooke.

594
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,420
I'm from Indiana, and I'm studying
biology and computer science.

595
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,170
DAVID MALAN: Nice.

596
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,190
Welcome.

597
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,670
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Becca.

598
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:34,695
I'm from, like, Maryland, DC area, and
I'm studying electrical engineering.

599
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:35,570
DAVID MALAN: Welcome.

600
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,840
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Addison.

I'm studying engineering.

603
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,130
AUDIENCE: Hi.

604
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,790
I'm Sharon.

605

DAVID MALAN: Welcome.

607
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,470
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Grace.

608
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,995
I'm from Alabama and I'm
studying electrical engineering.

609
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:50,870
DAVID MALAN: Welcome.

610
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,930
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Angelina.

611
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,680
I'm from Maryland.

612
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,970
And also, I stay in Matthews.

613
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,720
DAVID MALAN: Nice.

614
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,730
Matthews.

615
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,580
Nice.

616
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,030
[APPLAUSE]

617
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,530
AUDIENCE: And I'm studying
applied math and econ, as well as

618
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,610
environmental science and public policy.

619
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,810
DAVID MALAN: Welcome.

620
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,395
AUDIENCE: I'm Owen Bells and I'm from
rural Virginia and I'm studying CS.

621
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:08,520
DAVID MALAN: Nice, welcome.

622
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,398
And?

623
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:10,440
AUDIENCE: My name is Max.

624
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,520
I'm from London.

625
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,750
I'm also staying in Matthews and
I'm studying computer science

626
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,690
and neuroscience.

627
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,190
Thank you.

628
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,670
DAVID MALAN: Welcome aboard as well.

629
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,010
If you're wondering,
too, why I was wearing

630
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,843
these glasses at the start-- so
very common on the internet nowadays

631
00:31:21,843 --> 00:31:22,800
as these POV videos.

632
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,070
So it turns out these Ray-Bans
actually record video footage,

633
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,350
and we have a couple of them, and
we'd thought we would offer them

634
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,433
to a couple of volunteers.

635
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:32,150
If anyone wants to record their
point of view for everyone here.

636
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,830
And Vlad here is going to help
make sure they're recording.

637
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,790
Second volunteer.

638
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,960
Yes, number two.

639
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,740
All right.

640
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,880
So as Vlad gets those set, on
the backs of your pieces of paper

641
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,280
you have instructions for
the following three rounds.

642
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,660
Each round represents a letter.

643
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,480
The audience participation
part of this is

644
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,620
to actually do the mental math to figure
out what number these volunteers are

645
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,500
representing.

646
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,070
So go ahead and execute round one,
either keeping your hand down or raising

647
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,810
it appropriately.

648
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,350
OK.

649
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,486
What number are our
volunteers here representing?

650
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:06,220
AUDIENCE: 66.

651
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,280
DAVID MALAN: 66, because
we have a 64 plus a 2.

652
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,150
That then maps to what ASCII letter?

653
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:11,650
AUDIENCE: B.

654
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,290
DAVID MALAN: B was the first letter.

655
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,240
OK, hands down.

656
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,750
Round two, go.

657
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,050
A little harder.

658
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,734
What's now being represented?

659
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,098
AUDIENCE: 79.

660
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:24,640
DAVID MALAN: I'm starting to hear it.

661
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,980
79 is in fact correct.

662
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,360
79, because we have a 64 and
an 8 and 4 and 2 and a 1.

663
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,230
So if it's a 79, we
have the ASCII letter O.

664
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,160
So we've got BO, and
then lastly, third round.

665
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,660
Go.

666
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,530


667
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:47,360
We have 01010111.

668
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,490
What number is this?

669
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,453
AUDIENCE: 87.

670
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:50,120
DAVID MALAN: 87.

671
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,680
Which spells the letter?

672
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,460
AUDIENCE: W.

673
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,650
DAVID MALAN: W. Which spells the word?

674
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,250
AUDIENCE: Bow.

675
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,220
DAVID MALAN: Not bow.

676
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,850
Take a bow if you could.

677
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,350
All right.

678
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,475
A round of applause for
our volunteers here.

679
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:01,610
[APPLAUSE]

680
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,850
And come on off this way and help
yourself to a CS50 stress ball.

681
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,072
Thank you to our volunteers.

682
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:11,030
So this is only to say we've now
agreed on how we can represent numbers

683
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,060
from zero on up.

684
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,100
We've agreed on how we
can represent letters.

685
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,390
But at least letters using
ASCII, and in fact, these

686
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,660
are more than just decoration.

687
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,570
In fact, it's a little bit
of trivia by lecture's end.

688
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,090
If you to come up for your
very own CS50 stress ball,

689
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,480
turns out there are 64 light bulbs
at the foot of the stage here.

690
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,400
If you break them down
into 8 byte or single--

691
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,060
8 bit or single byte chunks,
there's an eight letter word

692
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,430
that happens to be spelled out
today using this here ASCII chart.

693
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,550
So today's mystery is what
exactly is that there word.

694
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,380
But of course, if you have only 8
bits, you can only represent, like,

695
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,240
256 characters, which sounds like
plenty for English, and indeed, it is.

696
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,250
Zero through nine, A through
B, capital and lowercase,

697
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,320
uppercase and lowercase,
as well as punctuation.

698
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,770
But there's so many
other human languages

699
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,910
in the world that have other characters.

700
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,420
For instance, we have not
just the English alphabet

701
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,620
we might see here on
a US English keyboard.

702
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,070
We have accented characters,
we have various Asian languages

703
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,330
have even many more glyphs.

704
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,900
We need more than 256
possible characters.

705
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,520
And so nowadays computers do
not just use 7 or even 8 bits.

706
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,150
They might use 8 bits for some letters,
like all of the English letters.

707
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,630
They might use 16 bits for
certain other languages.

708
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,330
Maybe even 24 or 32 bits.

709
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,532
And fun fact, if you have 32 bits--

710
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:32,199
and we have more than that on the stage.

711
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,040
If you've got 32 bits,
you can actually represent

712
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,260
as many as 4 billion possible
characters, which is quite a bit.

713
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,440
No pun intended.

714
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,510
So what else can we represent?

715
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,659
Well, the goal of this
system, not just ASCII,

716
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:49,449
but something known as Unicode,
which is a newer standard,

717
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:51,489
is to be backwards
compatible with ASCII.

718
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:56,500
So humans left all of those other
numbers alone, 65, 66, 67 and so forth,

719
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,880
but they added to it a
super set of representations

720
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,040
that maybe are 16, 24, or 32 bits.

721
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,410
The goal being to be able digitally to
represent all human languages, past,

722
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,690
present, and future, and even
through pictograms, things

723
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:17,760
like smiley faces and the like, even
people, places, things and emotions that

724
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,750
transcend human language.

725
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,220
And in fact, odds are within the past
few minutes or hours, most of you

726
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,810
have used one or more of these here
emoji, these pictograms, which it turns

727
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,790
out are just characters on a keyboard.

728
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,000
You might have to hit a special button
to pull up that form of the keyboard,

729
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,310
but these are just here characters.

730
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,828
And so these emoji have
exploded in popularity

731
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:41,370
for a number of reasons, one of
which is, my God, what are we

732
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,800
going to do with 4 billion possible
patterns of zeros and ones?

733
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,340
We can start to have some fun
with it and represent things

734
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,530
beyond English and
human languages alone.

735
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,590
Now, as an aside, when
it comes to Unicode,

736
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,800
it turns out Unicode, years ago,
standardized this pattern of 32 zeros

737
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,110
and ones to represent
just one of those emoji.

738
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,650
So emoji tend to use
even more bits here.

739
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,070
Anyone know what decimal number this is?

740
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,820
This is not a fun mathematical exercise.

741
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:17,610
The spoiler is 4,036,991,106 is the
decimal number that actually represents,

742
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:21,370
as of present, the most
popular emoji in the world.

743
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:27,196
Does anyone want to hazard a guess
what emoji this here number represents?

744
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:27,863
AUDIENCE: Heart.

745
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:28,654
DAVID MALAN: Heart?

746
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:29,230
Hearts?

747
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,800
No, but it's actually this
so-called face with tears of joy.

748
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,550
So perhaps think about the frequency
with which you send that one.

749
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,790
And even though it's obviously
a picture on the screen, sure,

750
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,120
it actually is more like a font,
because underneath the hood,

751
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,900
it's indeed just a pattern of
zeros and ones or a decimal number

752
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,260
that the computer is storing.

753
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,790
But the computer, be it Mac OS
or Windows or iOS or Android,

754
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,793
know to display that pattern
as this here picture.

755
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:57,460
But the pictures might look
different depending on the hardware.

756
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:57,960
Why?

757
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,260
Because there's companies like Google
and Microsoft and Meta and others

758
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,780
that have their own artists
on staff as employees,

759
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,320
and those artists
interpret the descriptions

760
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,700
like face with tears of joy differently.

761
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,350
So those of you with an Android phone
actually see face with tears of joy

762
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,953
looking a little something like this.

763
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:17,620
And if you have Telegram, for
instance, installed on your phone,

764
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,510
it's even more animated than that.

765
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,860
It's this here emoji using the
same pattern of zeros and ones.

766
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,400
So different artists render these
here emoji in different ways,

767
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,770
but all they are here are patterns.

768
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:34,030
Now, for all of the other answers, save
one that was shouted out a moment ago,

769
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,790
this is a sort of cloud diagram
of the most popular emoji as

770
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,400
of a couple of years ago per Unicode,
whereby the size of the emoji

771
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,450
indicates its relative popularity.

772
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,720
So heart, I did here
over here, is indeed

773
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,260
one of the most popular ones as well.

774
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,531
Question?

775
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:53,240
AUDIENCE: Why do certain
emojis show up [INAUDIBLE]?

776
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,823
DAVID MALAN: Oh, really good question.

777
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:57,740
Why do certain emoji not show
up on one device or another?

778
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,970
It depends on how
recent the software is.

779
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,350
Pretty much every year the humans
behind the Unicode consortium

780
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,650
release new emoji.

781
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,400
Which is to say they decide
that this other pattern will

782
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,800
represent this new emoji, this other
pattern will represent this new emoji.

783
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,200
And unless you update
your phone, your laptop,

784
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,060
your desktop to the very latest software
and the manufacturer of that device

785
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,120
or software also updates
by hiring an artist

786
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,550
to draw those pictures in their
own fonts, in their own style,

787
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,900
you're going to see usually just
an empty black square or maybe just

788
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,402
a black and white heart instead
of something more colorful.

789
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:31,610
Really just placeholders,
because, it's as though you

790
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,860
don't have the right
font installed or really,

791
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,870
you have an older version
of that same font installed.

792
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,040
But it's become sort of an annual
tradition that new and more emoji

793
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,450
are released every year, which is among
the reasons why these updates contain

794
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,510
more and more.

795
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,040
Yeah?

796
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,047
AUDIENCE: How do you
represent color in bytes?

797
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:50,630
DAVID MALAN: That is an amazing segue.

798
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,800
How do you represent color in bytes?

799
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,700
Well, you use RGB, which happens to
be, by coincidence, the next slide.

800
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,010
So let's again, recap.

801
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,570
We know how to represent letters.

802
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,020
We know how to represent numbers.

803
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,220
We can even represent emoji.

804
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,280
But those emoji
technically on the screen

805
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,960
are, of course, composed of colors,
like a whole bunch of yellow

806
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,430
for that there smiley face?

807
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,955
How do computers, then, using only
zeros and ones, represent colors?

808
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:16,830
Well, by convention, they typically
use a system that, by an acronym,

809
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,820
is called RGB.

810
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,750
Red, green, blue.

811
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,980
And this is to say that a computer, to
represent a single dot on the screen--

812
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,890
maybe this one, this one, this one--
will allocate some number of bits

813
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:33,600
or some number of bytes to represent the
color of just that, their dot, otherwise

814
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,810
known as a pixel.

815
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,890
You can actually see pixels on your
phone or even on your TV or monitor.

816
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,840
If you go really close, especially
if it's an older monitor,

817
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,880
you can see the tiny little squares.

818
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,710
Each of those has some number of bits
telling the device what color to use.

819
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:53,360
In particular, these devices typically
use three numbers in total, three bytes.

820
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,750
So that is to say 24 bits per pixel.

821
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,765
And they do this.

822
00:39:57,765 --> 00:40:00,640
If you were to represent a single
dot on the screen using these three

823
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,010
numbers, just by intent
here, this is 72, 73,

824
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:07,280
33, which in the context of
a text message, an email,

825
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,240
a Google Doc represents,
of course, hi, textually.

826
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,480
What if a computer
uses that same pattern

827
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,170
of zeros and ones, that is the
same pattern of decimal digits,

828
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,400
to represent the color on a screen?

829
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,698
Which is germane if you're
opening an image using Photoshop.

830
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:24,490
So using a different
piece of software that

831
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,400
knows about colors and
images and not just text.

832
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,940
Well, this would imply that
you want that dot on the screen

833
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,000
to have a medium amount of
red, a medium amount of green,

834
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,510
and a little bit of blue.

835
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,190
Why do I say medium and little?

836
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,840
Well, again, if each of these
numbers is using 8 bits or 1 byte,

837
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,260
the highest we can count,
as we discovered, was 255.

838
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,850
So I'm kind of averaging here.

839
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,650
So 72 at a 255 feels to me
like a medium amount of red.

840
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,290
33 feels relatively little blue.

841
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:58,190
But if now the computer combines those
wavelengths of light, so to speak,

842
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,320
a medium amount of red,
medium amount of green,

843
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,830
a little bit of blue, what you get
is the color code for a single dot.

844
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,840
And does anyone want to guess what
color roughly this represents,

845
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,143
these three bytes?

846
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:10,810
AUDIENCE: White.

847
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,100
AUDIENCE: Purple.

848
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,558
DAVID MALAN: Not white, not purple.

849
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:13,230
AUDIENCE: Brown.

850
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,320
DAVID MALAN: Not brown.

851
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,580
AUDIENCE: Yellow.

852
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,660
DAVID MALAN: Yellow,
in fact, is the answer.

853
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,520
So it represents in a single pixel
roughly this shade here of yellow.

854
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,110
Which is to say, if we look back at
any of those emoji, which, again,

855
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,760
are represented by
patterns of zeros and ones,

856
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,150
but you and I as humans perceive
them as images on the screen--

857
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,900
let me actually go ahead
and zoom and zoom in further

858
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,598
to one such sample emoji.

859
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:38,890
And when you zoom in far enough or you
put the phone close enough to your face,

860
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,610
you can actually see all
of those little dots known

861
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,630
as pixels, all of the little squares.

862
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,180
And given that so many of
these pixels are yellow,

863
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,450
that is to say that that
pattern of three bytes,

864
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:54,010
72, 73, 33, is used to
represent this pixel.

865
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:58,570
Another 3 identical bytes are used
to represent this pixel, this one,

866
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,920
this one, and so forth.

867
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,710
So now if you've taken digital
photos on your phone or a camera,

868
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,460
you're probably generally familiar
from the internet and hardware

869
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,330
today that a photograph is, what,
1 megabyte, 10 megabytes depending

870
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,050
on the resolution of it?

871
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,480
Well, megabyte means millions of bytes.

872
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,470
Where are all of these bytes
inside of these photographs

873
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,760
or these images you're
taking or downloading?

874
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,620
They correspond to every one of
the single pixels on the screen.

875
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:30,050
There's at least three bytes being used
to represent every one of those dots.

876
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,710
As an aside, bit of a white
lie because nowadays there's

877
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,590
fancy compression software that
can use fewer than that many bytes.

878
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,570
But in general, that's where all of
those bytes, those millions of bytes

879
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,980
are coming from.

880
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,380
So how is that for an answer
to how do we represent colors?

881
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,010
Thank you.

882
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,590
So if we agreed now that
there's this way and perhaps

883
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,960
others to represent
colors, well, how do we

884
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,610
represent not just images, but videos?

885
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,960
Well, videos once upon a time, or
movies, were called motion pictures.

886
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,120
So motion pictures with motion.

887
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,870
Why is that?

888
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,790
Well, it's analogous to growing up.

889
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,980
If you ever played with one of
these picture books-- and in fact,

890
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,397
there's memes nowadays that
have made these popular again,

891
00:43:09,397 --> 00:43:14,540
whereby why you have a whole bunch of
images on individual sheets of paper.

892
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,850
And if you flip through
them fast enough,

893
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,690
your human mind and eyes
perceive it as actual motion,

894
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,020
even though you're just seeing image,
image, image, image, image, image.

895
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,030
But it's so fast, it looks like motion.

896
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,610
That's all a video is on your screen.

897
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,950
That's all a film is on your TV.

898
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,140
It is not in fact, continuous motion.

899
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,780
It's maybe 30 frames or images
per second, maybe 24 frames

900
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,200
or images per second.

901
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,755
Which is to say, we know
how to represent numbers,

902
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:43,630
we know how to represent
letters, we know how

903
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,410
to represent colors and thus images.

904
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,580
Now we kind of get videos for free
because it's just more of the same.

905
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,560
Use more and more of those patterns.

906
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,390
Why are videos so darn large?

907
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,330
Why are they gigabytes to
download, billions of bytes?

908
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,280
Because there's so many darn images.

909
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,570
30 some odd images per second
in those kinds of videos.

910
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,600
And maybe lastly, just to
top off our multimedia,

911
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,090
how could you represent sound?

912
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,090
Maybe musicians in the room.

913
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,630
How, using only zeros and ones,
could you represent something

914
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,010
as sonorous as music?

915
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,580
Something analog as digital.

916
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,080
Yeah?

917
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,090
AUDIENCE: So each number
corresponds to a frequency.

918
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:21,700
DAVID MALAN: Yeah.

919
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,580
So each number that we
store in the computer

920
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,830
could correspond to a
certain frequency, which

921
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,455
has a direct relationship to the
sound or the pitch of a note.

922
00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:32,080
For instance, in the world of
piano and many other instruments,

923
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,830
you've got like your A, your B, your C,
maybe you have sharps and flats as well.

924
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,590
We could just agree,
like the ASCII people

925
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,130
did years ago, to represent
the musical note A, let's use

926
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,310
this pattern, musical note A-sharp,
let's use this pattern and so forth.

927
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,280
But maybe pitch alone or
frequency alone is not enough.

928
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,150
Maybe we need that number,
but maybe a second number

929
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,030
for the volume, the sort of
digital equivalent of how hard

930
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,630
are you hitting the key on the piano.

931
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,860
Maybe a third number for how long
are you holding the key down.

932
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:05,110
So maybe the pitch and the volume
and the duration, kind of like RGB,

933
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:10,210
we could use three bytes to represent
every musical note in some piece.

934
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,050
And if we wanted to keep track
of what instrument should

935
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,670
be played by the computer
to sound that music,

936
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,880
well, maybe that's just a fourth
byte or something else as well.

937
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,850
Which is to say, at
the end of the day, all

938
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,440
we have are these zeros and
ones to throw at the problem.

939
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,825
So for now, that's it for
representing information.

940
00:45:29,825 --> 00:45:31,700
We've got our numbers,
we've got our letters,

941
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,470
we've got our colors and images,
our videos, and now sound.

942
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:40,000
Any questions on how computers,
then, are representing, as promised,

943
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,500
those inputs and outputs
using just zeros and ones?

944
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,570
Yeah, in the middle.

945
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,550
AUDIENCE: The computer
is taking it as input.

946
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,190
DAVID MALAN: Correct.

947
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,190
So the computer is taking as input
at the end of the day, zeros and ones

948
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,750
and is outputting zeros and ones.

949
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,590
However, as we'll learn in this
class, by writing software,

950
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,430
by writing code that understands
those zeros and ones we will enjoy

951
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,470
not just literally
seeing zeros and ones,

952
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,310
we will see A, B, C, we will
see colors, we will see video,

953
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:12,350
we will hear sounds so long as we
write the code to interpret those zeros

954
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:12,990
and ones.

955
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,210
And indeed, it's worth
noting now that same pattern

956
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,530
I keep using for an example, 72,
73, 33, how does a computer know?

957
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,090
Is that the message hi?

958
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,710
Is that the color yellow?

959
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,100
Is it a dot in a video alone?

960
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,910
Just depends on the context.

961
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,230
Simply put, if you're opening
that pattern of zeros and ones

962
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,560
with Excel or a calculator
program, odds are

963
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,500
the software will interpret those
three bytes as numbers, of course.

964
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,590
If, though, you open that same
pattern in a text messaging program,

965
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,250
Google Docs, Microsoft
Word, that same pattern

966
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,187
will be interpreted as
a sequence of letters.

967
00:46:46,187 --> 00:46:48,270
Instead, if you open
Photoshop, that same pattern,

968
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:52,300
you'll probably see a single
dot that happens to be yellow.

969
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,770
Conversely, once you yourself are a
programmer or even better programmer,

970
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,810
you will be able to write in code
how you want the computer to treat

971
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,560
these patterns of zeros and ones.

972
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,020
You can essentially tell the computer,
use this to store a number or a letter

973
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,160
or a color or something else.

974
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,010
That's the power the programmer
themselves have at the end of the day.

975
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:19,380
Other questions on
representing things with bits?

976
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:19,880
No?

977
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
All right.

978
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,050
So lastly, then, in this middle
of this black box, so to speak,

979
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,630
is the sort of secret
sauce that solves problems,

980
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,050
that converts those inputs to
outputs, those problems to solutions.

981
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,250
So what is an algorithm?

982
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,540
It's really just step by step
instructions for solving some problem.

983
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,270
And indeed, I think back to
my own first time in CS50

984
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,120
where we learned the same from
Professor Brian Kernighan.

985
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,680
And as luck would have it, just had my
25th reunion where we pulled some video

986
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,430
footage from 1996.

987
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:52,130
And so we're actually fortunate to
have the very first few minutes of CS50

988
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,020
over 25 years ago when I myself took it.

989
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:59,010
But the lessons back then, as
today, are fundamentally the same.

990
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:03,780
And what's important, indeed, is to
not only express yourself correctly,

991
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,870
but precisely, as we'll explore today.

992
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:09,050
This then is Professor
Brian Kernighan, who,

993
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:13,760
years ago, very memorably introduced
us and my classmates to algorithms

994
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,520
by actually, in class,
shaving his beard.

995
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,760
If we could dim the
lights here for Brian.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

997
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,290
- The other thing that we're
going to talk about in this class

998
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,060
is the notion of an algorithm.

999
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,160
An algorithm is a very precise
description of how to do something.

1000
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,130
And the operative word there is precise.

1001
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,990
It has to be very, very,
very, very precise.

1002
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,990
And the task that I'm
going to do is that I'm

1003
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,995
going to trim my beard, which
has gotten out of whack.

1004
00:48:36,995 --> 00:48:40,868


1005
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:43,288
[APPLAUSE]

1006
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:45,230


1007
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:56,820
And I brought a variety of things which
one might use to trim beards with.

1008
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,295
[LAUGHTER]

1009
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:01,275


1010
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:03,750
[APPLAUSE]

1011
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:12,165


1012
00:49:12,165 --> 00:49:13,273
[END PLAYBACK]

1013
00:49:13,273 --> 00:49:15,940
DAVID MALAN: So suffice it to
say, I don't have much of a beard.

1014
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,168
But I do have this here other technology
known once upon a time as a phone book.

1015
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:22,960
And these phone books, of course,
have lots of information in them.

1016
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,380
Happen to be storing numbers
and letters in particular.

1017
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,340
For those unfamiliar, they are
storing human's names from A to Z

1018
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,050
here in English and associated
with everyone's name is a number.

1019
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,220
So even if you've never had occasion
to physically use this kind of device,

1020
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,060
turns out it's pretty much equivalent
to the contacts or the address book app

1021
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,200
on your iOS phone or your
Android phone as well.

1022
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,700
Why?

1023
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,700
Because if you pull up
your contacts, of course,

1024
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,140
you see some familiar names here
alphabetized by first name or last name.

1025
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,170
And if you click on
any of those names, you

1026
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,300
reach the person you're
presumably trying to call or text.

1027
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,201
Pictured here then is John
Harvard's, whose number here is plus

1028
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:59,860
1-949-468-2750, which you're welcome
to call or text at your leisure.

1029
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,030
But here is John Harvard that's partway
through the phone book digitally.

1030
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,460
Well, it turns out that
physically in the phone book,

1031
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,670
we might use an algorithm,
step by step instructions,

1032
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:14,690
for finding John Harvard in pretty
much the same way as iOS, Android,

1033
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,870
Mac OS, Windows, or other
operating systems themselves use.

1034
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,770
So I could, when looking for John
Harvard, first name, starting with J,

1035
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,770
I could start at the
beginning of the phone book

1036
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,490
and start looking page by
page by page for John Harvard.

1037
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,140
And if he's there, I can call.

1038
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,290
This is an algorithm.

1039
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,370
It's indeed step by
step, but that was a bug.

1040
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:34,540
A few pages turned.

1041
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:38,410
But is this algorithm correct?

1042
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,440
Step by step, assuming
I'm paying attention.

1043
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,860
So yes, if John Harvard is
in here, I will eventually

1044
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,470
find him once I get to the J section.

1045
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,720
Now, this is a little tedious.

1046
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,865
It's going to take a while.

1047
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:50,240
A few dozen, a few hundred pages.

1048
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,250
So maybe I could do things a little
smarter from grade school, like 2, 4, 6,

1049
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:00,140
8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and so
forth, going twice as fast.

1050
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,940
Is that algorithm correct?

1051
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,403
So no, but why?

1052
00:51:03,403 --> 00:51:04,570
AUDIENCE: You could miss it.

1053
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:05,660
DAVID MALAN: I could miss him, right?

1054
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,035
I could just get unlucky,
really, with 50/50 probability,

1055
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:11,930
because John Harvard could be
sandwiched between two pages.

1056
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,510
Now, this isn't a complete
loss, this algorithm.

1057
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:18,770
Maybe what I could do is if I
get past the J section to K,

1058
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,610
I could double back
at least one page just

1059
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,290
to make sure I didn't miss John Harvard.

1060
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:26,830
So I can still go twice as
fast plus an extra step just

1061
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,340
to make sure I didn't mess up.

1062
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,918
So the first algorithm
might take as many pages

1063
00:51:30,918 --> 00:51:32,210
as there are in the phone book.

1064
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,980
So if this phone book has a thousand
pages, in the worst case, if I'm not

1065
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,860
looking for John Harvard, but
someone whose name starts with Z,

1066
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,780
might take me a thousand
pages to actually get there.

1067
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,610
Second algorithm, twice as fast.

1068
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,420
Literally, it might take
me 500 plus one step

1069
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,410
to get there because
I'm going two at a time,

1070
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,102
so as long as I indeed fix that bug.

1071
00:51:50,102 --> 00:51:52,060
But what we used to do
back in the day and what

1072
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,910
your phone is doing
today, albeit digitally,

1073
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,560
is going roughly to the middle of the
phone book, looking down and realizing,

1074
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,410
oh, I'm accidentally in the M section,
so halfway through the phone book.

1075
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,600
But what do I now know
about John Harvard?

1076
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,750
Is he to the left or to the right?

1077
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,080
So he's obviously to the left,
because J comes before M. So what

1078
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,330
I can do literally and
what your computer does

1079
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:17,380
figuratively is tear the problem
in half, throw half of the problem

1080
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,140
away, leaving us now with
the same fundamental problem,

1081
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,430
but it's half as big.

1082
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:26,740
So I've gone from a thousand
pages suddenly to 500 pages.

1083
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:33,260
And compare this to the other two, 1,000
pages, 999, 998, versus 1,000 pages,

1084
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,080
998, 996, 994.

1085
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,310
That's still slow.

1086
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:41,540
I went from 1,000 to 500 in
just one step of this algorithm.

1087
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,327
What do I do next?

1088
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:43,660
I go roughly to the middle here.

1089
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,080
Oh, I went a little too far.

1090
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,670
I'm in the E section now.

1091
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,180
So is John Harvard to
the left or right now?

1092
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,270
So he's to the right.

1093
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,870
So I can again tear the problem
in half, throw the left half away,

1094
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,830
knowing now that John Harvard
must alphabetically be in here.

1095
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:01,750
And I can divide and divide and divide
and conquer this problem again and again

1096
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,610
by using that heuristic of
going left or going right.

1097
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,580
And I dare say, if I
do this correctly, I'll

1098
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,830
eventually be left with one single page
on which John Harvard's number actually

1099
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:11,330
is.

1100
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:14,720
Or maybe he's not in
the phone book at all.

1101
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,340
So how many steps maximally might
that third and final algorithm take?

1102
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,360
It's not a thousand.

1103
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,940
It's not even 500 or 501.

1104
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:27,490
How many times can you divide a
thousand pages in half again and again

1105
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:30,182
and again, roughly?

1106
00:53:30,182 --> 00:53:31,390
AUDIENCE: I want to say nine.

1107
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,750
DAVID MALAN: So 9, 10.

1108
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,610
So typically 10 times, give or take.

1109
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,610
There's a bit of rounding there because
it's not a perfect power of two,

1110
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,220
but roughly 10 times.

1111
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,150
Like, that is fundamentally better
than both of the two algorithms

1112
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:48,490
because I go from a thousand
pages to 500 to 250 to 125 and so

1113
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:52,280
forth, literally halving
the problem again and again.

1114
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,000
So we can actually appreciate and
see this even more so graphically.

1115
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,480
And this is among the things
we'll do later in the term

1116
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,250
when we speak to not only
writing correct code,

1117
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,620
but is your code well designed?

1118
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,080
Is it better than your previous code?

1119
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,970
Is it better than someone else's code?

1120
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,710
Is it better than some other product?

1121
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:13,190
If you have given more thought to the
algorithms and the quality thereof,

1122
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,090
you can perhaps minimize the
time required to solve problems

1123
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,470
but no less correctly.

1124
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,842
So if we have a simple xy plot
here, on the y-axis or vertical

1125
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,800
is the amount of time to
solve in whatever unit

1126
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,560
of measure, seconds, pages,
however you want to count.

1127
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,700
On the horizontal or x-axis is
the size of the problem measured

1128
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,700
in, for instance, numbers of pages.

1129
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,250
So this would mean zero
pages in the phone book.

1130
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,320
This would mean a lot of
pages in the phone book.

1131
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,120
This would mean no time to solve.

1132
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,980
This would mean a lot of time to solve.

1133
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,740
What's the relationship then,
among those three algorithms?

1134
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,190
Well, the first one is essentially
a straight line, a slope of one.

1135
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:50,660
And if the phone book
has n pages in it, we'll

1136
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:54,650
describe the slope here as
essentially 1 over 1 for the algorithm

1137
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:58,470
with the first algorithm,
turning page by page by page.

1138
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:02,880
Which is to say, if we were to add one
more page to the phone book next year,

1139
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,280
first algorithm is going
to take one more step.

1140
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,890
But the second algorithm
is definitely better.

1141
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,410
It's definitely faster, but
it's still a straight line.

1142
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:14,060
So it's going to take roughly n over
2 steps on average, because you only

1143
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,770
have to go through
half of the phone book

1144
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,478
because you're going
two pages at a time,

1145
00:55:17,478 --> 00:55:19,860
instead of the whole phone
book in the worst case,

1146
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,370
if someone's name is Z, to go
through every page in total.

1147
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:26,460
So if we actually compare these--
let me just draw some dashed lines.

1148
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,330
Suppose that you have this
many pages in the phone book.

1149
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,980
If you just draw this
vertical white line here,

1150
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,250
it's going to take this much time
in red using the first algorithm,

1151
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,460
but it's going to literally
take half as much time

1152
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,918
in yellow for the second
algorithm because you're literally

1153
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:41,280
going two pages at once.

1154
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,510
But the third and final algorithm
is a fundamentally different shape.

1155
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,030
It instead looks a little
something like this.

1156
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:51,180
It looks like it's flatter
and flatter and flatter.

1157
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,620
It's always increasing.

1158
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,300
It never gets perfectly flat.

1159
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,580
But it grows so much more slowly
as a function of phone book size.

1160
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,460
And for those who
recall their logarithms,

1161
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,845
this would be described
as log base 2 of n.

1162
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:06,720
And in fact, that's
where the math came from.

1163
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,560
Log base 2 of 1,000 is
roughly 10 in total,

1164
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,960
even if you need a calculator
to confirm as much.

1165
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,570
But this shape is
fundamentally different.

1166
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:16,070
Why?

1167
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,360
Well, suppose that Cambridge,
where we are, and Allston,

1168
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,193
the town across the street next
year, combine their two phone books.

1169
00:56:21,193 --> 00:56:25,333
And they go from a thousand pages each
to one phone book with 2,000 pages.

1170
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,500
The first algorithm is going
to literally take twice

1171
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,130
as many steps or pages.

1172
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:33,200
Second algorithm is going to
take half as many or 50% more

1173
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,680
because you're going two at a time.

1174
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,560
But the third algorithm is
going to barely miss a beat.

1175
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,060
Why?

1176
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:42,750
Because if this is a thousand pages
here and 2,000 pages is over there,

1177
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,030
just inferring from the
shape of the green line,

1178
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:50,270
it's not going to be much higher on the
vertical axis than the other two were.

1179
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:55,710
So more specifically, if you have
a 2,000 page phone book next year,

1180
00:56:55,710 --> 00:57:00,170
how many more steps will it take you
using that third and final algorithm?

1181
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,830
Just one, because you'll divide
and conquer a 2,000 page phone book

1182
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:07,950
into a 1,000 page phone book, and then
you're back at the original story.

1183
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:10,710
And that's the sort of power
of learning algorithms.

1184
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:14,060
That's the power of learning computer
science and learning how to program

1185
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,070
is to be able to navigate
big data, so to speak.

1186
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:20,990
Things the size of google, things the
size of artificial intelligence training

1187
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:23,750
data sets using better
and better, more clever

1188
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,127
algorithms that perform
faster, and therefore

1189
00:57:26,127 --> 00:57:27,960
not only make the
software more competitive,

1190
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,390
but also make it more usable and more
favorable for people like you and me

1191
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,380
when using that software.

1192
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,120
So when it comes to implementing
algorithms as programmers,

1193
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,590
as computer scientists, what you're
really doing is taking these algorithms,

1194
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:45,750
which might be expressed in English
conceptually as we just did,

1195
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,180
but really just
translating them to code,

1196
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:54,020
be it C or C++ or Python or R or Ruby or
any number of other languages that exist

1197
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,720
in the world.

1198
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,200
But for now, let's consider
how we might implement

1199
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,140
that algorithm using something that's
literally still English, but pseudocode.

1200
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,660
Something that is still
correct, but precise and finite,

1201
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,850
as per Professor
Kernighan's advice, which

1202
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:10,430
is to say use your own
vernacular of English and just

1203
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,480
say what you mean but very succinctly.

1204
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,400
There's no one way to write pseudocode.

1205
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,870
It's not some formal language.

1206
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:19,340
I'm just going to convert the
steps I did intuitively to step

1207
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,660
by step instructions as follows.

1208
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,340
Step one, what I did was pretty
much pick up the phone book.

1209
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,850
Step two, what I did was pretty
much open to middle of phone book

1210
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,120
for the third algorithm.

1211
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,790
Step three, look at page.

1212
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:37,830
Step four, if person is on page,
then, step five, call person.

1213
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,880
If that does not prove
to be the case, step six,

1214
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,180
else if the person is
earlier in the book, then

1215
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:51,650
open to the middle of the left half of
the book and then go back to line three.

1216
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,970
Then, else if the person
is later in the book,

1217
00:58:55,970 --> 00:59:00,830
open to the middle of the right half of
the book and, again, go to line three.

1218
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,150
Else, there's a fourth and final case.

1219
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:06,180
If the person like John Harvard is
not on the page, is not earlier,

1220
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,110
is not later, what's the fourth
scenario we'd best consider?

1221
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,540
He's just not there.

1222
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,950
Else we should do something
specific like quit.

1223
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,170
Now, as an aside, everyone
in this room has probably

1224
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,170
had one of these stupid
technical support issues

1225
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,670
where your phone or your
laptop or your desktop computer

1226
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:24,730
just freeze all of a sudden, or maybe
it spontaneously reboots for no reason.

1227
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:29,440
Odds are that's because not you but
some other human made a mistake.

1228
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,400
They probably wrote code
working at Microsoft or Apple

1229
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,860
or Google or somewhere else,
and they didn't actually

1230
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,310
anticipate that, oh, there
could be a fourth scenario that

1231
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:40,120
could happen in the real world.

1232
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,570
But if there's no code that
tells the computer what

1233
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,335
to do in that fourth
and final scenario, who

1234
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:46,960
knows what the computer is going to do?

1235
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,490
It might, by default, reboot.

1236
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,100
It might, by default, freeze.

1237
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:54,040
That's just a hint of the bugs,
the mistakes in software to come.

1238
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,420
But even though this is just
one way to write this code,

1239
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,590
a.k.a. pseudocode, there are
some salient characteristics

1240
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,420
that we'll use throughout today.

1241
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,540
One, there are these
verbs, these actions.

1242
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,610
And henceforth, as aspiring
computer scientists or programmers,

1243
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,880
we're going to start to call these by
what a more and more technical audience

1244
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,380
would.

1245
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,930
These are functions.

1246
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,450
A function is an action or a verb.

1247
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,600
It's like a bite-sized task
that a computer can do for you.

1248
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,540
Those then are functions
in this here pseudocode.

1249
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,060
But there's other types of code in here.

1250
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,440
There are these things here.

1251
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,240
If else if else if else.

1252
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,180
Those are examples of what we're
going to start calling conditionals.

1253
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,900
These are sort of proverbial forks in
the road where maybe you go this way,

1254
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,850
maybe you go this way, but you decide
which way to go based on a question.

1255
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,420
The questions that you ask
are what we'll technically

1256
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:47,150
call Boolean expressions named
after mathematician Boole.

1257
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:51,170
A Boolean expression is a
question with a yes or no answer,

1258
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:56,180
a true or false answer, a black or
white answer, a one or zero answer.

1259
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,840
There's two possibilities, and there's
a hint of the binary underneath.

1260
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,250
A Boolean expression is going
to tell you yes or no, you

1261
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:06,070
should go down that fork in the road.

1262
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:11,330
Notice what's important here is that
indentation mattered as a result.

1263
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:16,000
Notice that on line four when I first
asked if the person is on page question

1264
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,450
mark, so to speak, I should only
do line five per its indentation

1265
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,758
if the answer is yes
or true, I should only

1266
01:01:23,758 --> 01:01:26,800
open to the middle of the left half
of the book and go back to line three

1267
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,930
if person is instead
earlier in the book.

1268
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:33,220
So indentation in pseudocode and
in many programming languages

1269
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,090
has logical significance.

1270
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,580
It tells you whether
to do things or not.

1271
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,800
But there's another construct in here.

1272
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,660
Go back to.

1273
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:44,380
Go back to, which literally makes me
go back to line three, potentially

1274
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,380
again and again and again,
creating some kind of cycle

1275
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,750
or what we'll typically
call a loop instead.

1276
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:54,320
So even in this relatively
simple real world algorithm,

1277
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,520
we have these four fundamental
characteristics of most computer

1278
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,360
programs that we will
write in this class,

1279
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,010
and you might write beyond this class,
that we have some technical jargon now

1280
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,040
to describe them.

1281
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,270
But what's important to note
is that line 8 and line 11,

1282
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:11,720
even though they're saying go back
to line three, go back to line three,

1283
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,960
you might think you're
running the risk of what

1284
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,350
we'll call an infinite loop where
you literally get stuck in a loop

1285
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,118
forever, which doesn't sound like
a good thing if, at some point,

1286
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:22,910
you want to turn your computer off,
even though it's still working.

1287
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,060
But these will not
induce infinite loops.

1288
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:26,560
Why?

1289
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,460
What is happening in this particular
algorithm every time we go back to line

1290
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:35,930
three that guarantees eventually we
will stop going back to line three?

1291
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,972
AUDIENCE: The person is
on the page, you call it.

1292
01:02:37,972 --> 01:02:38,847
DAVID MALAN: Exactly.

1293
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,540
If the person is on the page, we
will call them or we will quit.

1294
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:45,380
But more importantly, because we keep
dividing and conquering the problem,

1295
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:48,200
in this case, having the phone
book, having the phone book,

1296
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,860
eventually we're going to run out of
phone book, in which case, indeed,

1297
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,150
John Harvard is either on that
page or not And we will call

1298
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:56,830
or we will quit instead.

1299
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,070
So we'll see in time.

1300
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,780
And in fact, allow me to promise.

1301
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,690
Odds are at some point
you will write code

1302
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,318
that seems to take control
over the computer for you,

1303
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:06,860
where it's doing something,
doing something, doing something,

1304
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,870
and it literally won't
respond to you anymore.

1305
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,680
That's just going to be because
of a mistake, a so-called bug

1306
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,310
that you yourself will invariably
have added to your code accidentally.

1307
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:20,503
But we'll show you ways for terminating
it or breaking out of those conditions.

1308
01:03:20,503 --> 01:03:22,420
And indeed, what we'll
do in just a little bit

1309
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:26,540
after a break for today's lecture
is explore not just these concepts,

1310
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,530
but some of the ways you can
use them to solve real and very

1311
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:31,335
visual and audio problems.

1312
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:33,460
But for now, let's at least
connect it to something

1313
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:37,150
that's been all too germane in recent
months, the past few years, namely

1314
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,740
artificial intelligence, which
is a topic we'll come back to

1315
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,900
at the end of the
course, too, to give you

1316
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,270
a sense of what the connection
is with what everyone's

1317
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,610
been talking about in
the world of AI and what

1318
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:50,480
it is we're going to spend the next few
weeks building up to by writing code.

1319
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,090
If you were to try to implement
something like a chat bot,

1320
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,270
for instance, that just
answers questions and has

1321
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,300
a conversation with you, you
could do that using pseudocode,

1322
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:03,470
and as we'll soon see, you can use C,
Python, any number of other languages

1323
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:04,010
too.

1324
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,470
That pseudocode might look like
this when implementing a chat bot.

1325
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,470
You could tell the chat bot, if
the student says hello to you,

1326
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,450
then say hello back.

1327
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:16,370
And the indentation, as per earlier,
implies this is conditional.

1328
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:20,700
Else if the student says goodbye
to you, say goodbye to the student.

1329
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,420
Else if the student asks you
how you are, say you are well.

1330
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:27,170
So you can just enumerate question
after question after question

1331
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:30,930
and just handle all of these
conditional possibilities.

1332
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:32,990
But things kind of escalate
quickly, especially

1333
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:35,150
with the tools of today like ChatGPT.

1334
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:37,970
Are we really going to have
the wherewithal as programmers

1335
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:41,660
to write another conditional like else
if the student asks why 111 in binary

1336
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,910
is 7 in decimal-- like,
this kind of hints at,

1337
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,890
oh my God, there's an
infinite number of things

1338
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,810
this human could ask the chat bot.

1339
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:51,660
Do we really have to write an
infinite number of conditionals?

1340
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,372
That's just not possible.

1341
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:55,080
Like, there's not
enough time in the day,

1342
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,230
there's not enough
lines of code available.

1343
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,770
Artificial intelligence surely needs
to be able to figure some of this

1344
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:01,950
out instead.

1345
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:05,490
And so indeed, this is
not how you implement AI,

1346
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:08,360
but rather how you implement
an AI like a chat bot

1347
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,630
is you typically train it
based on lots and lots of data.

1348
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:15,680
You give it lots of inputs,
lots of inputs, training data,

1349
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,730
and let it figure out what it should
say in response to certain questions.

1350
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:22,650
And it boils down to
a lot of probability,

1351
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:26,310
a lot of statistics, otherwise
known now as large language models,

1352
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:29,480
which, if we really peek under the
hood, are actually typically implemented

1353
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,730
with what are called neural networks
inspired by the world of biology,

1354
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:35,510
whereby we humans have
all of these neurons that

1355
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:38,840
transmit electrical signals such
that my brain tells my hand to move

1356
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,590
this way, this way, and this other way.

1357
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:43,640
And so what computer
scientists have been doing over

1358
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,990
the past many years is implementing
in software using literally zeros

1359
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:51,405
and ones, graphs or networks,
neural networks, that

1360
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:54,780
look a little something like this, where
each of the circles represents a neuron,

1361
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,620
each of the arrows represents
a pathway between them,

1362
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:01,460
and provides as input to
these networks huge amounts

1363
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,820
of data like all of the internet,
all of Wikipedia, all of the books

1364
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,540
that it might consume as input.

1365
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:11,030
And then the goal of this neural
network, as per this single final neuron

1366
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:14,160
right here, is to produce
an answer to a question.

1367
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,200
Maybe it's simple like, yes, no, or
maybe it's something like the answer

1368
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,340
to the 111 question or how are you
or goodbye or hello or the like.

1369
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,870
And what these neural networks do
is use statistics and probability

1370
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:31,550
and try to output the most
probabilistically likely answer

1371
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:36,450
to this question that's been asked and
really just hope that it is correct.

1372
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,600
There is no programmer
at OpenAI or Google

1373
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,200
or Microsoft that's trying to
anticipate every one of these questions

1374
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:46,500
we might ask, not only in English
but in other languages as well.

1375
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,500
So you might be wondering why there's
this 8 foot duck on the stage.

1376
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:54,185
So the persona that CS50's own AI
takes is in fact that of a rubber duck,

1377
01:06:54,185 --> 01:06:56,060
because it turns out in
programming circles--

1378
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,050
and this is true long before CS50--

1379
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:01,280
it has often been recommended to
students and aspiring programmers

1380
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,800
that you keep literally a
physical rubber duck on your desk.

1381
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,630
The idea being, in the absence of
a friend, family member, colleague,

1382
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:12,290
TA who could answer technical
questions for you, if you're alone

1383
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:17,240
in your room in Mather at night, you
can talk to the duck, maybe door closed,

1384
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,340
and ask the duck your
questions, or, more importantly,

1385
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,180
talk the duck through what
confusion you're having.

1386
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,640
And the mere act of talking
through the problem,

1387
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,970
explaining logically what you're trying
to do, what you're actually doing,

1388
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:32,340
and what the error
actually is, invariably,

1389
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:36,090
that sort of proverbial light bulb goes
off and you realize, oh, I'm an idiot.

1390
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:38,910
I hear in my own words
where I've gone awry.

1391
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:42,820
And even though this duck will never
say anything back to you, that alone,

1392
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:47,530
rubber duck debugging or rubber ducking,
tends to be a valuable programming

1393
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,070
technique, believe it or not.

1394
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,080
But thanks to these
large language models,

1395
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,780
we have not only physical
but virtual ducks as well.

1396
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,670
And so available to you will be in
this class not tools like ChatGPT

1397
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:00,470
and the like, which are,
through policy, disallowed.

1398
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:03,560
It is not reasonable to
use ChatGPT and the like.

1399
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:08,020
But you are allowed and encouraged
to use CS50's own AI based

1400
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,010
tools, which resemble those same
tools but know something about CS50

1401
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:15,610
and aspire to behave akin to a
good teaching fellow guiding you

1402
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:19,160
to solutions as opposed to
handing you something outright.

1403
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,399
So this is a tool that will
be available at literally

1404
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:22,939
this URL throughout the course.

1405
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:24,130
CS50.ai.

1406
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:27,250
It will also be embedded in the
programming environment you'll soon

1407
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:31,069
meet, which is called Visual Studio
Code, a cloud based version thereof.

1408
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:35,590
The duck will live in that environment
as well, as well as on stage from time

1409
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:39,140
to time, which is to say we'll
not only talk about, but use

1410
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,380
throughout the course
this thing known as AI.

1411
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:46,066
But this is ultimately code that we're
going to start writing next week.

1412
01:08:46,066 --> 01:08:47,899
And unfortunately, this
code here is written

1413
01:08:47,899 --> 01:08:51,050
in a language called C. This is
essentially the program that I lost

1414
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,870
two points on some 25 plus years ago.

1415
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:56,810
It does look admittedly cryptic.

1416
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:01,020
That's why today what we'll focus
on is not what this code looks like,

1417
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:06,229
nor the zeros and ones that that code
gets converted to so your computer

1418
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:08,910
can understand as input
what you want it to do.

1419
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:12,000
We're going to focus on a much
more visual incarnation of this.

1420
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,670
But I know thus far this has been a lot.

1421
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:16,410
So let's go ahead and take
a five minute break here,

1422
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:19,710
and when we come back in five,
we'll do some actual programming.

1423
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,859
So see you in five.

1424
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:24,380
All right.

1425
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:29,910
So it's now time to solve with
actual code some actual problems,

1426
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,430
albeit in a fun and
visual and audio way.

1427
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,970
But recall that where
we left off was this.

1428
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,670
Starting next week, you'll be writing
code that ultimately looks like this,

1429
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,370
but thankfully, you will not
be writing zeros and ones,

1430
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:43,370
and no normal person,
myself included, can

1431
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:46,747
understand what all of these
zeros and ones are at a glance.

1432
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:48,830
We could take out some
paper, pencil, and probably

1433
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,609
figure it out very tediously.

1434
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:52,770
But this is exactly the point.

1435
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:56,360
Computers only understand this
stuff, but what we as programmers

1436
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:01,525
will start writing today and
beyond is code at a higher level.

1437
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:02,900
And indeed, this is going to be--

1438
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,390
this is going to be frequent
within computer science

1439
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:08,695
where there's different levels of
abstraction that we operate at.

1440
01:10:08,695 --> 01:10:11,570
And the lowest level, the nittiest
gritty, is like the zeros and ones

1441
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:12,780
that computer understand.

1442
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,850
That's it in this class
for zeros and ones.

1443
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,790
Hopefully you at least
have wrapped your mind

1444
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:20,570
around why zeros and ones
can be used in triples

1445
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:23,940
and as bytes to represent
higher and higher numbers.

1446
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:27,240
But let's just now agree
that computers can do that.

1447
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,170
Let's abstract away from
that detail and focus

1448
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:34,285
on higher level languages than zeros
and ones, namely a language like this.

1449
01:10:34,285 --> 01:10:36,410
So this is an example of
the very first programming

1450
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:40,130
language I learned back in the day as
per that homework in a language called

1451
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:40,710
C.

1452
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:44,480
It's an older language, but it remains
one of the most popular languages

1453
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,710
in omnipresent languages nowadays
because it's incredibly fast

1454
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:53,520
and it's particularly good at
making devices operate quickly.

1455
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,090
For us pedagogically,
the value of C is not

1456
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:59,630
that you're probably in Silicon
Valley and other such jobs

1457
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,780
going to be using C yourself
that much, but because it's

1458
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,620
going to provide a conceptual
foundation on top of which we introduce

1459
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:10,290
other languages, like Python, which
is newer and improved, so to speak,

1460
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:14,580
that gives you more and more
functionality for free out of the box

1461
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:19,198
by abstracting away some of the stuff
we'll focus on in the coming days first.

1462
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:20,990
So at the end of the
day, you should better

1463
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:23,930
understand languages like
Python and JavaScript

1464
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:29,160
and SQL because of your underlying
understanding of a language like C.

1465
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,922
But this is too much for the first day.

1466
01:11:30,922 --> 01:11:33,630
Many of you will think that this
is too much for the second week.

1467
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:37,280
But in fact, C is really
only sort of scary

1468
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,798
looking because all of this darn
punctuation and syntax, the semicolon,

1469
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:43,590
the parentheses, the double quotes,
the curly braces, and the like.

1470
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,310
And I concur.

1471
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:48,200
This is intellectually uninteresting,
and a lot of the challenges early

1472
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,410
on when learning programming is you
just don't have the muscle memory

1473
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,620
that I or some of the teaching
fellows might for knowing

1474
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,460
what symbol should be where.

1475
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:00,720
But that's going to come with
time and practice, I guarantee it.

1476
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,050
What we'll do for today,
though, is just throw away

1477
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:08,580
all of that intellectually uninteresting
detail and focus really on ideas.

1478
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,610
And some of you might
be in your comfort zone

1479
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,350
here because if back
in middle school you

1480
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,850
were playing with a programming
language called Scratch,

1481
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:18,420
you were probably using at the time just
to have fun in class or out of class,

1482
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,880
making games, animations,
interactive art.

1483
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,240
What you probably didn't use it
for, at least in middle school,

1484
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,870
was to consider and explore
programming languages themselves.

1485
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:31,370
But what's wonderful about Scratch,
which is this graphical programming

1486
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:34,830
language from down the street at MIT,
where it was invented some years ago,

1487
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:37,880
is you can program not by
using your keyboard per se,

1488
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:41,860
but by dragging and dropping puzzle
pieces, otherwise known as blocks,

1489
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,350
that will snap together if it
makes logical sense to do so.

1490
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,850
And what you won't have to deal with
is parentheses and double quotes

1491
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:51,830
and semicolons and all of
that, at least until next week.

1492
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:54,580
But the nice thing about
Scratch is that after this week

1493
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,450
and after the so-called
problem set zero,

1494
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:58,580
the first assignment in
which you'll use Scratch,

1495
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:02,890
you'll have a mental model via
which it will be easier to pick up

1496
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:05,240
all of the subsequent syntax as well.

1497
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,140
So let's see how we can
start programming in Scratch

1498
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,550
by making the simplest
of programs first.

1499
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:13,707
You can do this at scratch.mit.edu.

1500
01:13:13,707 --> 01:13:15,290
You needn't do this now in the moment.

1501
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,810
Problem set zero will walk you
through all of these steps.

1502
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:23,170
But what I've done here is opened
up at scratch.mit.edu, precisely

1503
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:26,030
the default web page therein.

1504
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,240
This is after having
clicked the Create button

1505
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,100
in Scratch, which is going to allow
me to create my first program.

1506
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:34,000
But first, a tour of
the user interface here,

1507
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,620
and what is ultimately available to you.

1508
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,200
Well, within the Scratch
environment, we'll

1509
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,160
see a few different
regions of the screen.

1510
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,580
One, we have this palette
of puzzle pieces at left.

1511
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,450
The blue ones relate to motion,
the purple ones relate to looks,

1512
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:50,880
the pink ones relate
to sound, and so forth.

1513
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,480
So the color of the blocks
just roughly categorizes

1514
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,797
what that block's purpose in life is.

1515
01:13:55,797 --> 01:13:58,880
We're going to be able to use those
puzzle pieces by dragging and dropping

1516
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,353
them from left to right.

1517
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,270
In the right here, in
the middle of the screen

1518
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,350
is where I'm going to
write my actual programs.

1519
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:06,558
This is where I'll drag and
drop these puzzle pieces,

1520
01:14:06,558 --> 01:14:09,330
lock them together, and
actually write my code.

1521
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:11,220
What am I going to be coding?

1522
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,470
Well, I'm going to be
controlling one or more sprites.

1523
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:16,553
Much like in the world of games are
familiar, a sprite is like a character

1524
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:17,970
that you might see on the screen.

1525
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,000
The default character
in the world of Scratch

1526
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,230
is, in fact, a cat that looks like this.

1527
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:24,840
And if in this case,
I have just one cat,

1528
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,980
I can then make that cat do things
in his own little world at top right

1529
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:31,470
by making the cat move
up, down, left, right,

1530
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:33,647
spinning around, or doing
other things as well.

1531
01:14:33,647 --> 01:14:35,480
But if you want to
introduce a dog or a bird

1532
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,780
or any number of other custom
characters, you just add more sprites

1533
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:41,940
and they get their own
place in that same world.

1534
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,982
As for how to think about
movement in this world,

1535
01:14:43,982 --> 01:14:45,857
it's actually pretty
familiar, even though it

1536
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:47,490
gets a little numeric for a moment.

1537
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:52,530
If Scratch at the moment is in the
middle of the screen, the cat is at 0, 0

1538
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,350
if you think about x, y-coordinates
or latitude longitude.

1539
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:58,590
If you move the cat all the way
up, this would still be x equals 0,

1540
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:00,510
but it would be y 180.

1541
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:01,720
What's the 180?

1542
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,710
180 pixels vertically
or dots on the screen.

1543
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:08,250
This is negative 180 pixels
on the screen at the bottom.

1544
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:11,630
By contrast, if you go left and
right, your x value might change.

1545
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:17,580
Negative 240, but y is 0, or
positive 240 and y is 0 as well.

1546
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,750
But most of the time you won't
need to know or care about what

1547
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,070
the pixel coordinates of the cat are.

1548
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:26,120
All you're generally going to care
about is the programmer, most likely,

1549
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,630
is do you want the cat to go
relatively up, down, left, or right,

1550
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:32,810
and let MIT figure out the mathematics
of moving this thing around

1551
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,340
in most cases.

1552
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,040
All right.

1553
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,700
So let's go ahead and introduce
the first of these programs

1554
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:42,890
by doing something quite simple, as we
did in C there, but a little more simply

1555
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:44,520
by writing code as follows.

1556
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,330
I'm going to go back to scratch.mit.edu.

1557
01:15:47,330 --> 01:15:50,070
I've already clicked, per
before, the Create button.

1558
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:53,600
And if I click on the yellow
category of blocks here at left--

1559
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,790
and I'll zoom in-- we'll see a
whole bunch of yellow puzzle pieces.

1560
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,730
And probably the most
common one you will

1561
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:02,390
use to write code in Scratch for
just this first week is literally

1562
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,110
when green flag clicked.

1563
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:04,640
Why?

1564
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,470
Well, if we go back over to
the cat's world at top right,

1565
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:10,530
notice that above the
cat's rectangular world,

1566
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:12,720
there's not only a
green flag for starting,

1567
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,600
there's a red stop sign
for stopping as well.

1568
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,560
So let's do this.

1569
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,150
Let me go ahead and click and drag.

1570
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:21,420
When green flag clicked anywhere
into the middle and let go.

1571
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:25,100
And now I'm going to go
to looks, and it looks

1572
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,480
like there's a whole bunch
of purple puzzle pieces here.

1573
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,950
I'm going to choose something
simple like say hello, drag it.

1574
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:33,200
And notice if I get
just close enough, it's

1575
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,340
going to want to
magnetically snap together.

1576
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,260
So I'll just do that
and it does its thing.

1577
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,410
The fact that there's
this white oval with text

1578
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:44,040
means that is an input to
this, say, puzzle piece.

1579
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,070
I can literally then
change what the input

1580
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:49,590
is if I want to more
conventionally say hello, world.

1581
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:54,590
Which in fact, according to lore, was
the very first program written in C,

1582
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:59,190
and nowadays in most every language,
including in Brian Kernighan's book.

1583
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:01,370
So hello world is
generally the first program

1584
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:03,960
that most any programmer first writes.

1585
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,900
So that's it as programs go.

1586
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,350
Let me go ahead and zoom out here.

1587
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:11,400
Let me go over to the right and click
the green flag, and somewhat excitingly,

1588
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:15,680
maybe underwhelmingly, we've now
written a program that quite simply says

1589
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,367
hello world on the screen.

1590
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:19,950
Now let's make this a little
more technical for just a moment.

1591
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:22,350
What is this here puzzle
piece, as I keep calling it?

1592
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:24,850
It's actually a similar--

1593
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:29,220
it's an incarnation one of the
ideas from our pseudocode before.

1594
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:33,543
What did we call those actions and
verbs last time in my pseudocode?

1595
01:17:33,543 --> 01:17:34,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1596
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,418
DAVID MALAN: Functions.

1597
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:36,090
That's right.

1598
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:40,010
So these purple puzzle pieces
here are indeed functions,

1599
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:44,610
and some functions, as we can see,
take inputs, like hello comma world.

1600
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:47,190
After all, how does
Scratch know what to say?

1601
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:49,790
You have to provide the
cat with input, which

1602
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,290
is to say functions can
indeed take inputs like this.

1603
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:54,620
In this case one input,
but we'll see opportunities

1604
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:56,850
for passing in more input as well.

1605
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:00,440
What the cat is doing though, visually
on the screen here at top right,

1606
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,460
is what's generally
called a side effect.

1607
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:06,180
Sometimes when you call a function,
it does something visually.

1608
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,630
And in this case, you're seeing
literally a cartoon speech

1609
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:09,870
bubble, hello world.

1610
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:12,180
That is the side effect
of this function.

1611
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:15,380
So if we now want to map this to
our world of inputs and outputs

1612
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,780
and see where this side effect
is, this is the paradigm

1613
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:21,800
I proposed at the start of class that
is computer science in a nutshell

1614
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,870
and will be the framework
we use literally

1615
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:26,345
throughout the class, no matter how--

1616
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:29,070
no matter how the languages
in particular evolve.

1617
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:31,950
So what's the input to
this particular program?

1618
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,680
Well, this white oval,
hello world is my input.

1619
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,950
The algorithm, step by step
instructions for solving some problem,

1620
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:41,760
is implemented in code,
this language called Scratch

1621
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,690
by way of this purple puzzle piece.

1622
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:47,650
And the output of that
function, given this input,

1623
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:52,080
is the side effect whereby the cat
indeed says hello world visually

1624
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,220
on the screen in that speech bubble.

1625
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,790
So the exact same paradigm
with which we began today

1626
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:59,667
governs how exactly this cat here works.

1627
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:01,500
Well, let's actually
go back to this program

1628
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,660
and make it a little more
interesting than that.

1629
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,700
Let me go ahead and
click the red stop sign.

1630
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,933
And let me actually use a different type
of puzzle piece, another function that

1631
01:19:09,933 --> 01:19:11,350
does something a little different.

1632
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:13,570
First, I'm going to get
rid of the say block.

1633
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:15,330
So I'm going to not
only pull it away, I'm

1634
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:17,950
going to drag it over anywhere
at left and just let go

1635
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,200
and it will delete itself automatically.

1636
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,260
Or I could right click or Control
click, and from a little menu

1637
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,510
I could also explicitly say delete.

1638
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:28,090
And what I'm going to
do now is under sensing,

1639
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:32,080
which is a light blue shade of puzzle
piece-- there's a whole bunch here,

1640
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,610
but I'm going to focus on this one.

1641
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:36,250
Ask something and wait.

1642
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,193
And the default text
is, what's your name?

1643
01:19:38,193 --> 01:19:38,860
And that's fine.

1644
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:40,620
But because it's a
white oval, that input

1645
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,900
can be manually changed by me if
I wanted to change the question.

1646
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,340
I'm going to drag it over here.

1647
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:48,130
It's going to magnetically
snap together.

1648
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:49,720
And I'm OK with that question.

1649
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,365
But what do I want to
say with the answer?

1650
01:19:52,365 --> 01:19:53,740
Well, let's go ahead and do this.

1651
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:55,990
I could go to looks again.

1652
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:59,260
I could grab another say
block, let it snap in,

1653
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:03,850
and I could say something
like, hello, David.

1654
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:06,640
But this is going to be the
first of many bugs that I make,

1655
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,170
intentionally or otherwise.

1656
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,870
Let me click the green flag.

1657
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:13,820
Scratch is now, just like in a web
browser, prompting me for some input

1658
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:14,320
here.

1659
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,945
So let me go ahead and type in my name.

1660
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:16,540
David.

1661
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,290
Enter.

1662
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,390
And voila.

1663
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,370
It works.

1664
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:20,320
Hello, David.

1665
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,820
I'm kind of cheating, though, right?

1666
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:25,240
Because if I zoom out,
stop, and play again.

1667
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:30,520
Let me type in Julia's name here,
enter, and it still says hello, David.

1668
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,430
So that didn't really implement
the idea that I wanted.

1669
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:35,110
All right, so how can I fix this?

1670
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:38,020
Well, it seems that this time
I want more than a side effect.

1671
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,990
I want to use the value
that the human types in.

1672
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:43,770
And for this, we need
another feature of functions,

1673
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:46,270
which is that not only can they
sometimes have side effects,

1674
01:20:46,270 --> 01:20:47,680
something visually happens.

1675
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:52,650
Some functions can hand you back
a value, a so-called return value,

1676
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:57,910
that will allow you to actually
reuse whatever the human typed in.

1677
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:01,380
So a return value is something that
gets virtually handed back to you

1678
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:04,620
and you can store it in something
called a variable, like x, y, and z

1679
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:08,530
in mathematics, and you can
generally reuse it one or more times.

1680
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,500
So let me actually
draw our attention then

1681
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:15,430
to, at left, not only the blue puzzle
piece, ask what's your name and wait,

1682
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:18,400
but notice that there's a
special puzzle piece below it,

1683
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,140
this blue oval called answer, and
that represents what a computer

1684
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,040
scientist would call a return value.

1685
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,120
So MIT has kind of bundled
it together side by side

1686
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,130
to make clear that one of those
pieces relates to the other.

1687
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:32,320
What it means is that I can do this.

1688
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:37,313
I can drag this oval and use this oval
as the input to the save function.

1689
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:40,480
Now, notice it's not the same size, but
it is the right shape, so that's OK.

1690
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,260
Scratch will grow or shrink
things to fit properly.

1691
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,300
But this too isn't quite right.

1692
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,940
Let me go ahead and do this.

1693
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,575
Let me go ahead and stop
that, click the green flag.

1694
01:21:50,575 --> 01:21:51,700
I'll type in my name again.

1695
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,030
D-A-V-I-D. Enter.

1696
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,410
And it's just kind of weird or rude.

1697
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:59,590
Like, I wanted a hello at least, and
it just said David on the screen.

1698
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:00,820
OK, so I can fix that.

1699
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,920
Let me stop with the red stop sign.

1700
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,860
Let me just separate these temporarily.

1701
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,860
And I can leave it in the
middle there, but they

1702
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,040
have no logical connection temporarily.

1703
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,810
Let me go back up to looks.

1704
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:14,130
Let me grab a say block, a
second one, and let me go ahead

1705
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,500
and say, just to be
grammatical, hello, space.

1706
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,630
And then I'll reconnect this here.

1707
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:23,290
So at the moment it looks like
what I want, I want a hello, comma,

1708
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:28,060
and then the return value printed out
based on whatever the human typed in.

1709
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,170
So let me zoom out.

1710
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,930
Let me click the green flag.

1711
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:32,910
Again, what's your name?

1712
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:36,450
D-A-V-I-D. And watch
the cat's side effect.

1713
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:38,140
Enter.

1714
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:41,620
It's still not greeting me properly.

1715
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,650
There's no hello.

1716
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:44,770
And if in case it was too
fast, let's do it again.

1717
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:45,650
Green flag.

1718
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:47,230
D-A-V-I-D. Enter.

1719
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:49,550
It rudely just says my
name, which is weird.

1720
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,290
What's the bug here, though?

1721
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:53,760
It's a little more subtle.

1722
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,260
Why?

1723
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:54,900
Yeah?

1724
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,370
AUDIENCE: It's just quickly going.

1725
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:57,120
DAVID MALAN: Yeah.

1726
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,088
It's just too quickly going over
the say command or the say function,

1727
01:23:00,088 --> 01:23:00,630
in this case.

1728
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,630
My Mac, your PC, your phone,
it's just so darn fast.

1729
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,750
Both are happening, but too fast
for my human eyes to even notice.

1730
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,295
So we can solve this
in a number of ways.

1731
01:23:09,295 --> 01:23:11,670
I could actually use a different
puzzle piece altogether.

1732
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,460
In fact, MIT kind of anticipated this.

1733
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:16,970
Notice the first puzzle
piece in purple is say hello

1734
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:18,840
for a specific number
of seconds, and you

1735
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,840
can specify not just the
message, but the number

1736
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:25,560
of seconds, ergo two inputs, otherwise
now known as arguments to a function.

1737
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,460
An input to a function
is just an argument now.

1738
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,360
And that would be a fix here.

1739
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,240
I could maybe a little
more explicitly do this.

1740
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:37,080
I could go under events, scroll
down a little bit, and-- sorry,

1741
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,430
under control in orange,
I could grab a wait block

1742
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:42,510
and I could kind insert
it in the middle.

1743
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:43,890
And this might actually help.

1744
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:45,890
So I could click on the green flag.

1745
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,670
D-A-V-I-D. Enter.

1746
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:49,370
Hello, David.

1747
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:51,810
And I could change the timing
to be a little more natural.

1748
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:55,070
But what if I want the cat to
just say hello, David all in one

1749
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,470
breath, so to speak.

1750
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:59,700
Well, for that I'm going to need to
use a slightly different technique as

1751
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:00,460
follows.

1752
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,380
Let me go ahead and get rid of the wait.

1753
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:06,100
Let me get rid of the second say block
and stop the cat with the stop sign.

1754
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:10,800
Let me go under operators here and
let me somewhat cleverly grab this.

1755
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,790
A join block at the bottom.

1756
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:15,250
By default, it's using apple
and banana as placeholders,

1757
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,440
but those are white ovals
so I can change those.

1758
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:22,110
Let me drag this over the white
oval for the save function and let

1759
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:23,890
go, and it will snap to fill.

1760
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:28,870
Let me go ahead here and type hello,
comma, space instead of apple.

1761
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:31,450
And what should I do instead of banana?

1762
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:32,250
AUDIENCE: Answer.

1763
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,000
DAVID MALAN: Yeah.

1764
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,850
So it'd be answer return value--

1765
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:36,880
the return value.

1766
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,580
So let me go under sensing again.

1767
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,230
Let me just drag another copy of it.

1768
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:42,730
And you can use these
again and again and again.

1769
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:43,840
They don't disappear.

1770
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:49,020
I want to drag answer over banana
so that the second input to join

1771
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:53,910
is actually, if you will, the
output of the ask block, like that.

1772
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:55,300
And it snaps to fit.

1773
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,970
So now if I go ahead and click
the green flag once more.

1774
01:24:57,970 --> 01:24:59,770
D-A-V-I-D. Enter.

1775
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:03,820
Now we have the behavior
aesthetically that I cared about.

1776
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,090
But beyond the aesthetics
of this, the goal here

1777
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:10,480
really was to map it to, again, this
same paradigm, which we'll see here.

1778
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,380
The algorithm and the output and the
input for this example are as follows.

1779
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:17,500
The input to the say block was,
quote, unquote, what's your name?

1780
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,490
The function, of course,
implementing that algorithm in code

1781
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,410
was the ask and wait block.

1782
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:27,130
The output, though, of the ask block
recalls not some visual side effect.

1783
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:30,400
It is a return value called
answer, like a variable,

1784
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,900
a special variable like
x, y, and z in math.

1785
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,320
But in this one, we
generally in programming

1786
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,750
describe variables with actual
words, not just letters.

1787
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:43,480
But this output of the say block,
I kind of want to make room for it

1788
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,282
to pass it into the say
block as a second argument.

1789
01:25:47,282 --> 01:25:47,990
So let's do this.

1790
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:51,610
Let's take one step back and
propose that now for the join

1791
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,510
block that I just used.

1792
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:57,290
It takes two inputs
hello, space and answer.

1793
01:25:57,290 --> 01:26:00,140
The function in question
is indeed the join block.

1794
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:03,050
The output of this had
better be hello, David.

1795
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:05,540
What do I want to do with
the output of the join block?

1796
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,310
Well, let me clear the screen.

1797
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:11,680
Let me move this over, because
now the output of the join block

1798
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:15,280
is going to instantly become
the input to the say block

1799
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,130
so that the output now
in this multistep process

1800
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:21,320
is the side effect of hello, David.

1801
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:26,260
So the fact that I nested these
blocks on top of one another

1802
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:27,680
was very much deliberate.

1803
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:33,010
If I zoom in here, notice that hello
and answer are on top of join, join

1804
01:26:33,010 --> 01:26:34,390
is on top of the say block.

1805
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,140
And if you think back
to high school math,

1806
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,810
this is like when you
had parentheses and you

1807
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:41,060
had to do the things inside parentheses
before the things outside parentheses.

1808
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:44,920
It's the same idea, but I'm just
visually stacking them instead.

1809
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:49,797
But outputs can become inputs depending
on what the function there expects.

1810
01:26:49,797 --> 01:26:51,880
Let me pause here and see
if there's any questions

1811
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:58,870
about not so much what the cat is
doing, but how the cat is doing this.

1812
01:26:58,870 --> 01:27:02,180
Questions at hand?

1813
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:02,790
All right.

1814
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:06,270
Well, let's make the cat
more cat-like and do this.

1815
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:09,600
Let me throw away all the say
block and just let go there.

1816
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,200
And let me introduce at bottom
left a nice feature of scratch

1817
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,000
whereby there's also
these extensions that

1818
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,280
tend to use the cloud, the internet,
to give you even more functionality.

1819
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,520
And in fact, I'm going to click on
this extension up here, text to speech.

1820
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,750
And if I click on that, I
suddenly get a whole new category

1821
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:24,890
of blocks at the bottom.

1822
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:25,950
Text to speech.

1823
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:27,270
They happen to be green.

1824
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:29,300
But what's nice here is
that I can actually now

1825
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,340
have the cat say something audibly.

1826
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:36,180
So let me drag the speak block
here instead of the say block.

1827
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:38,280
I don't want it to just say hello.

1828
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,240
Let me stop that.

1829
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,340
So let me go back under operators.

1830
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:44,430
Let me grab another join block,
because I threw the other one away.

1831
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:47,190
Let me change apple
to hello, space again.

1832
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:48,420
Let me go to sensing.

1833
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,060
Let me drag answer to banana again.

1834
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:55,880
And now let me hit the green flag and
let me type in my name, D-A-V-I-D.

1835
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,400
And in a moment I'll hit enter and.

1836
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,822
COMPUTER: Hello, David.

1837
01:27:59,822 --> 01:28:00,780
DAVID MALAN: All right.

1838
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:03,667
It's not exactly cat-like,
but it was synthesized.

1839
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:06,750
But it turns out under these text to
speech blocks, there are some others.

1840
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:10,570
Set voice to alto, for instance,
seems to be the default.

1841
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:11,740
But let's change this.

1842
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:14,650
So notice that some puzzle pieces
don't just take white ovals.

1843
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:16,000
They might even have drop downs.

1844
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,720
So whoever created that
puzzle piece decided

1845
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:23,315
in advance what the available choices
are for that input per the dropdown.

1846
01:28:23,315 --> 01:28:25,440
So I'm going to change it
to squeak, which sounds--

1847
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,640
or actually kitten sounds even more apt.

1848
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:31,500
Let me zoom out, click the
green flag, type my name.

1849
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,030
D-A-V-I-D. Enter.

1850
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:35,247
COMPUTER: Meow, meow.

1851
01:28:35,247 --> 01:28:36,580
DAVID MALAN: That's interesting.

1852
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:38,380
So it doesn't seem to
matter what I type.

1853
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,620
So how about David Malan.

1854
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,300
COMPUTER: Meow, meow, meow.

1855
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,030
DAVID MALAN: So it seems to
meow proportional to how long

1856
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,980
the phrase is that I typed in.

1857
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,520
It can get a little creepy quickly.

1858
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,680
If I change kitten to giant.

1859
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,210
Let me go ahead and hit Play.

1860
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:54,690
D-A-V-I-D. Enter.

1861
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:56,650
COMPUTER: Hello, David.

1862
01:28:56,650 --> 01:29:00,070
DAVID MALAN: So you can,
for very non-academic ways,

1863
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:02,260
start to have fun with this,
but just playing around

1864
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,843
with these various inputs and outputs.

1865
01:29:03,843 --> 01:29:06,992
But let's actually make the cat do
something more cat-like and indeed meow

1866
01:29:06,992 --> 01:29:08,450
instead of saying any words at all.

1867
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:10,090
So let me throw all of that away.

1868
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,840
Let me go now under sound.

1869
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,590
Let me drag the play sound until done.

1870
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:18,760
And notice in the dropdown here, by
default, you just get the cat sound.

1871
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,240
You can record your own sounds.

1872
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,970
There's a whole library
of dogs and birds

1873
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:24,920
and all sorts of sounds you
can import into the program.

1874
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,140
I'll keep it simple with cat.

1875
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:28,360
And let me click the green flag.

1876
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:29,092
COMPUTER: Meow.

1877
01:29:29,092 --> 01:29:30,050
DAVID MALAN: All right.

1878
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:31,153
So the cat meowed once.

1879
01:29:31,153 --> 01:29:33,195
If I want the cat to meow
again, I could do this.

1880
01:29:33,195 --> 01:29:34,540
COMPUTER: Meow.

1881
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:37,735
DAVID MALAN: If I want the cat to meow
a third time, I could again hit play.

1882
01:29:37,735 --> 01:29:38,360
COMPUTER: Meow.

1883
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:40,930
DAVID MALAN: So this is kind of
tedious if to play this game,

1884
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:43,430
I have to keep clicking the
button, keep clicking the button

1885
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:46,050
to keep the cat alive
virtually in this way.

1886
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:48,890
So maybe I want this to happen
again and again and again.

1887
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,070
Well, let me just do that.

1888
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:51,480
Let me sort of drag and drop.

1889
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,140
Or I could right click
or Control click and then

1890
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,942
a little menu would let me
Copy-Paste or duplicate blocks.

1891
01:29:56,942 --> 01:29:58,650
But I'll just keep
dragging and dropping.

1892
01:29:58,650 --> 01:29:59,525
Let's do this.

1893
01:29:59,525 --> 01:30:00,150
COMPUTER: Meow.

1894
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:00,990
Meow.

1895
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:01,830
Meow.

1896
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:03,760
DAVID MALAN: Cat's kind
of hungry, unhappy.

1897
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,610
So let's slow things down
so it's adorable again.

1898
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:09,640
So let me go under control.

1899
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:13,150
Let me grab one of those wait one
second, and I'll plop this here.

1900
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:13,840
Another one.

1901
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,950
Let me plop it here.

1902
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:15,755
Click play again.

1903
01:30:15,755 --> 01:30:17,142
COMPUTER: Meow.

1904
01:30:17,142 --> 01:30:18,630
Meow.

1905
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:19,530
DAVID MALAN: Cuter.

1906
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:20,500
Less hungry.

1907
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,030
Sure.

1908
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:23,830
But this program is
now, I daresay, correct

1909
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:26,890
if my goal is to get the
cat's meow three times.

1910
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:31,210
But now, even if you've never programmed
before, critique this program.

1911
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:35,140
It is not well-designed,
even though it is correct.

1912
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,440
In other words, it could be better.

1913
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,470
How, might you think?

1914
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:42,042
Yeah?

1915
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:42,750
AUDIENCE: A loop.

1916
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,930
DAVID MALAN: So using a loop.

1917
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:44,430
And why?

1918
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:47,360
Why are you encouraging me to use
a loop even though it works as is?

1919
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,720
AUDIENCE: It's easier to plot.

1920
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,470
DAVID MALAN: Yeah.

1921
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:51,960
So to summarize, it's
just easier to use a loop

1922
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:55,220
because I could specify explicitly
in one place how many times I want it

1923
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:55,720
to loop.

1924
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:00,060
And moreover, frankly, any time you are
copying and pasting something in code

1925
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,730
or dragging the same thing
again and again, odds are you're

1926
01:31:02,730 --> 01:31:03,880
doing something foolish.

1927
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:04,380
Why?

1928
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:07,080
Because you're repeating
yourself unnecessarily.

1929
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,210
And this is a bit extreme,
but suppose I want

1930
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:13,830
to change this program later so that the
cat pauses two seconds in between meows.

1931
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:16,180
Well, obviously I can just
go in here and do two.

1932
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,500
But what if I forget?

1933
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:20,710
And suppose this program isn't,
like, five or six puzzle pieces.

1934
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:23,590
Suppose it's 50 or 60 or 500 or 600.

1935
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:26,410
Eventually I or a colleague I'm
working with is going to screw up.

1936
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:29,710
They're going to change a value in one
place, forget to change it in another.

1937
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,740
So why are you inviting the
probability of making a mistake?

1938
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:37,270
Just simplify things so that you only
have to change inputs in one place.

1939
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:38,440
So how can I do this?

1940
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:39,340
Let me zoom out.

1941
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,770
Let me throw most of
this duplication away,

1942
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:44,740
leaving me with just the
play and the wait function.

1943
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:48,040
Let me now, under control
as well, grab one of these.

1944
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,030
I could, for instance,
repeat as follows.

1945
01:31:50,030 --> 01:31:51,350
Let me grab a repeat.

1946
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:53,300
I'm going to have to
move these in two parts.

1947
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,592
So I'm going to move this down.

1948
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,170
It's too small, but it will
grow to fit the right shape.

1949
01:31:57,170 --> 01:31:59,360
Then let me reattach it up here.

1950
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,670
Let me change the default 10 to a 3.

1951
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:05,110
And now I think I've done exactly what
you were encouraging, which is simplify.

1952
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:06,560
And I click play now.

1953
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,407
COMPUTER: Meow.

1954
01:32:09,407 --> 01:32:10,070
Meow.

1955
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:11,720
DAVID MALAN: Now and.

1956
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:12,420
COMPUTER: Meow.

1957
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:13,170
DAVID MALAN: Yeah.

1958
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:16,750
So still correct, but arguably
better designed as a result.

1959
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:19,830
I can keep things simple and
change things now in just one place

1960
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:21,257
and it will continue to work.

1961
01:32:21,257 --> 01:32:23,340
But this is getting a
little tedious now, I claim.

1962
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:26,700
Like, why am I implementing
the idea of meowing?

1963
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:30,480
Wouldn't MIT have been better
to have just implemented

1964
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,042
a meow puzzle piece for us?

1965
01:32:32,042 --> 01:32:34,000
Because the whole thing
is themed around a cat.

1966
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,770
Why is there not a meow puzzle piece?

1967
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:39,910
Why do I need to go through all of this
complexity to build that functionality?

1968
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:41,888
Well, what's nice about
Scratch and what's

1969
01:32:41,888 --> 01:32:43,680
nice about programming
languages in general

1970
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:47,740
is you can generally invent your own
puzzle pieces, your own functions,

1971
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,570
and then use and reuse them.

1972
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:50,890
So let me go ahead and do this.

1973
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:54,130
I'm going to go under my
blocks in pink down here.

1974
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:56,280
I'm going to go ahead
and click make a block,

1975
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,530
and I'm going to be prompted
with this interface here.

1976
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:01,488
And I'm going to call this block
literally meow, because apparently MIT

1977
01:33:01,488 --> 01:33:03,130
forgot to implement it for us.

1978
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:05,590
And I'm just going to go ahead
and immediately click OK.

1979
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,570
And what you'll see now is two things.

1980
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:11,580
One, on the screen, I've been
given this placeholder pink piece

1981
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:14,780
that says define meow as follows.

1982
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:17,980
So anything I attach to the
bottom of that define block

1983
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:20,840
is going to define the
meaning of meowing.

1984
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,900
And at top left, notice
what I have under my blocks.

1985
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:27,050
I now have a pink
puzzle piece called meow

1986
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:31,450
that is a new function that will do
whatever that other block of code

1987
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:33,102
tells the cat to do.

1988
01:33:33,102 --> 01:33:34,310
So what do I want to do here?

1989
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:36,060
Well, I'm going to
keep it simple for now.

1990
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:40,355
I'm going to move the play sound
meow until done and wait two seconds.

1991
01:33:40,355 --> 01:33:42,980
Though let's change it back to
one second to move things along.

1992
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:45,730
And now let me drag
the meow puzzle piece

1993
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:49,160
over to my loop such that
now, what's it going to do?

1994
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,750
It's going to meow three times.

1995
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:54,410
And just to be dramatic,
out of sight, out of mind.

1996
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:57,090
Let me, for no technical
reason, just drag

1997
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,590
this all the way to the bottom
of the screen and then scroll

1998
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:04,340
back up just to make the point
visually that now meowing exists.

1999
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:07,820
That is an implementation detail
that we can abstract away,

2000
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:12,710
not caring how it exists, because I
now know at a higher conceptual level,

2001
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:16,090
if I want a meow, I just use the meow
puzzle piece, and I or someone else

2002
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:18,770
dealt with already how
to implement meowing.

2003
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:20,480
So now let me go ahead and hit play.

2004
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,360
COMPUTER: Meow.

2005
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,240
Meow.

2006
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,180
Meow.

2007
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:27,940
DAVID MALAN: OK, so same exact
code, but arguably better

2008
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:31,930
design because I've now given
myself reusable code so I don't have

2009
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:33,520
to Copy-Paste those several blocks.

2010
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,510
I can just use meow again and again.

2011
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:37,070
But let's make one refinement.

2012
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:40,130
Let me actually scroll down to
where I did in fact implement this.

2013
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:42,460
Let me Control click
or right click on it

2014
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:45,250
and let me edit the pink
block that I created

2015
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:49,160
a moment ago, because I want to practice
what I've been preaching about inputs.

2016
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,500
So I don't want this function
just to be called meow.

2017
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:55,210
I want this function
to also take an input,

2018
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:58,810
and just for consistency with our use
of n earlier, which in computer science

2019
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:03,080
generally means number,
let me meow n times.

2020
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,710
And just so that this puzzle piece
is even more programmer friendly,

2021
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:10,690
let me add just a textual label
that has no technical significance

2022
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:13,780
other than to make this
function read left to right

2023
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,500
in a more English friendly way.

2024
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,330
Meow n times.

2025
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:18,405
Let me click OK.

2026
01:35:18,405 --> 01:35:22,150
And now notice this thing at
the bottom has changed such

2027
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:26,130
that it's not only called meow,
there's explicit mention of n,

2028
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:30,950
which is a circle, which is exactly
the variable shape that we saw earlier

2029
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:32,330
when it was called answer.

2030
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:34,290
This is not a return value, though.

2031
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:38,340
This is what, again, we're going to call
an argument, an input to a function.

2032
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:39,452
So let me do this.

2033
01:35:39,452 --> 01:35:41,160
I'm going to move this
back up to the top

2034
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,060
so I can see everything
in one place, and I'm

2035
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:47,090
going to make one modification,
because my goal now

2036
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:51,440
is to make a new and improved version of
meowing that actually takes into account

2037
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,150
how many times I want the cat to meow.

2038
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:59,520
So instead of using a loop in my own
program under when green flag clicked,

2039
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,620
I'm going to detach this temporarily.

2040
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:03,360
I'm going to move this away.

2041
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:07,920
I'm going to move this code over here,
and I'm going to reattach it here.

2042
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,260
So focusing for the
moment on just the left,

2043
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:14,990
meow is now defined as repeating three
times the following two functions.

2044
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:16,605
Play sound and wait.

2045
01:36:16,605 --> 01:36:17,730
But that's not quite right.

2046
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:19,260
I want to get rid of the three.

2047
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,820
So what can I do?

2048
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:25,530
Because I created this input to the
meow function myself a moment ago,

2049
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:28,140
I can actually drag a
copy of it over right

2050
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,530
that is change the three
to be generally an n.

2051
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:35,820
So now I have a function called meow
that will meow any number of times.

2052
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:41,250
And what's nice now is my actual program
that is governed by that green flag,

2053
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:45,960
I can type in three, I can type in 10, I
can type in 100, and it will just work.

2054
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,230
And henceforth, I can,
again, dramatically

2055
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:51,690
scroll this down so we don't
know or care about it anymore.

2056
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:55,400
Now my program is a single line
whereby this notion of meowing

2057
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:00,440
has been abstracted away by just
defining my own function or custom

2058
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,840
block.

2059
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,840
Questions, then, about just
this idea, this principle

2060
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:09,580
of creating your own functions to hide
implementation details once you've

2061
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:10,430
solved a problem?

2062
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:13,180
Therefore, you don't want to have
to think about that same problem

2063
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:13,960
ever again.

2064
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:17,470
And that's the beauty of
programming, typically.

2065
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:22,780
Questions on what here we just did?

2066
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:23,280
No?

2067
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:23,920
All right.

2068
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:24,840
Well, let's do this.

2069
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,490
Let's now make this a little
more interactive in code.

2070
01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:28,908
Let me go to this green flag.

2071
01:37:28,908 --> 01:37:31,200
Let me scroll down and just
throw all of this hard work

2072
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:34,408
away that we have copies on the courses
website of all of these programs step

2073
01:37:34,408 --> 01:37:37,240
by step if you want to
review them in slower detail.

2074
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:37,950
Let's do this.

2075
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:41,080
Under control, turns out
there's other ways to loop.

2076
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:44,260
There's this forever block that
will just do something forever.

2077
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:47,740
So in the forever block, there's
some place for some other code.

2078
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:50,310
And I'm going to move
to the control section

2079
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:54,280
here and grab one of these if
blocks, so one of these conditionals.

2080
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,630
Let's plug that in here.

2081
01:37:55,630 --> 01:38:00,480
And now notice if, and then there's
this sort of trapezoid-like placeholder

2082
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,000
that's going to probably fit what?

2083
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,890
The if is a conditional.

2084
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:06,780
Forever is a loop.

2085
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,190
Say and so forth have been functions.

2086
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:11,340
What was the other key term we used?

2087
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,860
So a Boolean expression.

2088
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:15,610
We need to put one of those yes,
no or true, false questions here.

2089
01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:16,390
So what are those?

2090
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:18,370
Well, I've been using
Scratch for some years,

2091
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:21,730
so I under sensing there's
one of these shapes here.

2092
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:23,840
Touching mouse pointer, question mark.

2093
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,010
The question mark literally evokes
the whole idea of a Boolean expression

2094
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:27,950
being yes, no.

2095
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:30,350
It's way too big to fit,
but it is the right shape.

2096
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:31,220
So let me drag it.

2097
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:31,910
Let go.

2098
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:33,440
It's going to grow to fill.

2099
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,480
And now let me go to sound.

2100
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,690
Let me grab that play
sound, meow until done,

2101
01:38:37,690 --> 01:38:41,320
and put it inside that conditional
such that what kind of program

2102
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:44,710
have I just implemented here, arguably?

2103
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:47,010
What will this program do
when I click the green flag?

2104
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:50,000


2105
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,328
Well, nothing at the moment.

2106
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:54,620
AUDIENCE: Not touching the cat.

2107
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:55,680
DAVID MALAN: But I'm
not touching the cat.

2108
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,960
So if I move the mouse
pointer to the cat.

2109
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,418
COMPUTER: Meow.

2110
01:38:59,418 --> 01:39:00,210
DAVID MALAN: Again.

2111
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:01,013
COMPUTER: Meow.

2112
01:39:01,013 --> 01:39:01,805
DAVID MALAN: Again.

2113
01:39:01,805 --> 01:39:02,610
COMPUTER: Meow.

2114
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:05,860
DAVID MALAN: It's kind of implementing
the idea of petting a cat, if you will,

2115
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:08,380
because I'm forever just
waiting and waiting and waiting.

2116
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:12,280
Is the mouse pointer touching
that sprite, touching that cat?

2117
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,712
And only if so, go ahead and
play that sound meow until done.

2118
01:39:15,712 --> 01:39:17,920
But now we can make things
a little more interesting.

2119
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,640
Let me stop this and let me do
something actually completely different.

2120
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,740
Let me throw all this hard work away.

2121
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,390
Let me go under extensions.

2122
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:28,690
Let me go to video sensing, because
lots of laptops, my own included,

2123
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:30,340
has a little webcam nowadays.

2124
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,440
Let me approve use of that there.

2125
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,030
And you can see me in the frame.

2126
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:34,990
And let me do this.

2127
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:38,470
Let me drag one of these when
motion exceeds some measure.

2128
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:41,770
And through trial and error, I figured
out that 50 tends to work well.

2129
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:45,340
Let me step out of frame here
and program off to the side.

2130
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:48,670
And if I go to play
sound meow until done,

2131
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:53,800
notice that this is an alternative
to using when green flag clicked.

2132
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,860
This is a category of
block that's constantly

2133
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,790
waiting for what we'll call an event.

2134
01:39:57,790 --> 01:40:01,670
An event is just something that can
happen on the screen, a click, a drag,

2135
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:03,530
a mouse movement, and so forth.

2136
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,020
So let me zoom out here.

2137
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:09,750
And now, if I can do this-- here we go.

2138
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,160
No, too slow.

2139
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,390
Still too slow.

2140
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:14,410
Wait, did I click play?

2141
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:14,910
Let's see.

2142
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:17,700


2143
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,434
Try again.

2144
01:40:20,434 --> 01:40:21,358
COMPUTER: Meow.

2145
01:40:21,358 --> 01:40:22,400
DAVID MALAN: There we go.

2146
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:22,900
OK.

2147
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,480
50 is a little too high, apparently.

2148
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,650
So let's make this a little gentler.

2149
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:27,150
10.

2150
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:27,950
COMPUTER: Meow.

2151
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:29,175
DAVID MALAN: OK, well.

2152
01:40:29,175 --> 01:40:29,800
COMPUTER: Meow.

2153
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:30,842
DAVID MALAN: There we go.

2154
01:40:30,842 --> 01:40:31,504
COMPUTER: Meow.

2155
01:40:31,504 --> 01:40:32,546
DAVID MALAN: There we go.

2156
01:40:32,546 --> 01:40:33,020
COMPUTER: Meow.

2157
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:36,270
DAVID MALAN: OK, so we've implemented
now more physically the idea of actually

2158
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:38,935
responding to petting a cat.

2159
01:40:38,935 --> 01:40:39,560
COMPUTER: Meow.

2160
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:40,060
Meow.

2161
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:41,300
DAVID MALAN: Oh, damn it.

2162
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:41,800
OK.

2163
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:42,858
COMPUTER: Meow.

2164
01:40:42,858 --> 01:40:43,358
Meow.

2165
01:40:43,358 --> 01:40:44,210
Meow.

2166
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:44,520
DAVID MALAN: All right.

2167
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,330
So this is a bug.

2168
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:49,100
Like now-- this is MIT's fault.
So it's not stopping in response

2169
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,940
to the red stop sign.

2170
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:52,200
So what do you do in doubt?

2171
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,300
Most extreme, you reboot.

2172
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:56,180
For now, I'm just going
to close the window.

2173
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:56,730
OK.

2174
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:59,810
So now we've seen all
of those primitives

2175
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:03,395
that we saw in that pseudocode, but
incarnated in this graphical programming

2176
01:41:03,395 --> 01:41:06,770
language, and again, without parentheses
and semicolons and double quotes and all

2177
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:09,060
that punctuation that we
will introduce before long.

2178
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:12,170
But for now, we have
the mechanisms in place

2179
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:14,340
where we can do some
really interesting things.

2180
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:18,060
So in fact, I thought, in the spirit
of thinking back on olden times,

2181
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:21,470
thought I'd open up the very first
program I wrote when I actually took--

2182
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:24,140
I was cross-registered
in an MIT class and took

2183
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:27,840
a class that introduced
aspiring teachers to Scratch.

2184
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,420
And I implemented this
program here called Oscartime,

2185
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:33,630
which was a game that used a
childhood song that I was a fan of

2186
01:41:33,630 --> 01:41:37,680
and it allows you to drag
trash into a trash can.

2187
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,640
But to bring this to life and perhaps
in exchange for one stress ball,

2188
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:43,760
could I get one brave volunteer who
wants to come up and control this here

2189
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,260
keyboard?

2190
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,177
I saw your hand first.

2191
01:41:45,177 --> 01:41:46,150
Come on up.

2192
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:49,480
Come on up.

2193
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:53,440
And you'll see, thanks to the team, we
also have this amazing lamppost here,

2194
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,942
being on Quincy Street as we are.

2195
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:56,900
Do you want to introduce
yourself to the group?

2196
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,960
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Anna.

2197
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,855
I'm from Richmond,
Virginia, and I'm in Weld.

2198
01:42:01,855 --> 01:42:02,605
DAVID MALAN: Nice.

2199
01:42:02,605 --> 01:42:02,920
Weld.

2200
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:03,470
AUDIENCE: Yes!

2201
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:05,012
DAVID MALAN: All right, come on over.

2202
01:42:05,012 --> 01:42:06,820
So here, Anna, you'll
have a chance to play

2203
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,520
the very first game I wrote
in Scratch, which admittedly

2204
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,368
is more complicated
typically than we would

2205
01:42:11,368 --> 01:42:14,660
expect of a student doing this for the
very first time, as in problem set zero.

2206
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,610
But what I'm going to do
is full screen this here.

2207
01:42:16,610 --> 01:42:18,880
I'm going to click the green flag,
and what you'll see on the screen

2208
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,838
are these instructions.

2209
01:42:19,838 --> 01:42:23,840
Drag as much falling trash as you can to
Oscar's trashcan before his song ends.

2210
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,099
And here we go.

2211
01:42:26,099 --> 01:42:28,877
[OSCAR THE GROUCH, "I LOVE TRASH"]

2212
01:42:28,877 --> 01:42:32,350
Oh, I love trash

2213
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:36,570
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty

2214
01:42:36,570 --> 01:42:40,920
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty

2215
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:44,620
Yes, I love trash

2216
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:45,120


2217
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,200
DAVID MALAN: There we go.

2218
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,420
So as Anna continues to play, let's
tease this apart a little bit.

2219
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:51,780
So one, there's some
costumes on the stage.

2220
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:54,340
Like that lamppost is
actually never going to move.

2221
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:56,110
But there's a couple of sprites.

2222
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:59,330
There's the trash can, which seems
to be a character unto itself.

2223
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:01,830
There's this piece of trash
that keeps coming back and back.

2224
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:02,920
That is a sprite.

2225
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,710
There's now this sneaker,
which is another sprite.

2226
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,940
And in fact, notice that Oscar, of
course, keeps popping up from his sprite

2227
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:10,090
once in a while.

2228
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:12,232
So Oscar seems to have
multiple costumes.

2229
01:43:12,232 --> 01:43:14,940
So I offer this as an example, as
you keep playing, if you would.

2230
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,548
Very good job so far.

2231
01:43:16,548 --> 01:43:17,590
The song goes on forever.

2232
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:20,340
This was a nightmare to implement,
to listen to this all day long.

2233
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:23,230
But how do we implement
the rest of this?

2234
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:26,400
Well, notice that the trash, every
time she throws into the trash can,

2235
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,760
does reappear somewhere different.

2236
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,860
So there's some kind
of randomness involved.

2237
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:34,610
And indeed, Scratch will let you
pick random numbers in a range.

2238
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:36,610
So maybe it could be
negative 240, maybe it

2239
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:40,670
could be positive 240, at the 180
point on the top of the screen.

2240
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:43,100
So you can randomly put
things on the screen.

2241
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,070
There's apparently
what kind of construct

2242
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:47,245
that makes the trash
fall again and again.

2243
01:43:47,245 --> 01:43:48,620
I think no one's listening to me.

2244
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:51,340
They're all just watching you.

2245
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:54,910
What's making the trash
fall from top to bottom?

2246
01:43:54,910 --> 01:43:58,210
So it's actually some kind of loop
because there's a motion block

2247
01:43:58,210 --> 01:44:00,640
inside of a forever
loop, probably, that just

2248
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:04,340
keeps moving the trash one pixel, one
pixel, one pixel, one pixel, one pixel,

2249
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:06,680
creating the illusion,
therefore, of motion.

2250
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,740
And if we can crank the
song a little bit more,

2251
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,920
you'll see that this is
all synchronized now.

2252
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,362
OSCAR THE GROUCH: (SINGING)
Because they're trash

2253
01:44:15,362 --> 01:44:19,180
Oh, I love trash

2254
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:23,140
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty

2255
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:24,560
Anything ragged--

2256
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,340
DAVID MALAN: The song keeps
going forever, seemingly.

2257
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:31,560
And now notice more and more sprites
are appearing because they waited for--

2258
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:32,060
here we go.

2259
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:32,620
Climax.

2260
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:39,552
OSCAR THE GROUCH: (SINGING) I love trash

2261
01:44:39,552 --> 01:44:40,510
DAVID MALAN: All right.

2262
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:42,670
A big round of applause for Anna.

2263
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:43,960
Nicely done.

2264
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:44,850
OK, here you go.

2265
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:46,200
Here you go.

2266
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:46,700
All right.

2267
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,950
So this is an interminable song.

2268
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:52,330
And indeed, I spent hours building that,
and just listening to that song on loop

2269
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:53,930
was not the best way to program.

2270
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:58,630
But the goal here is to really use it as
just an intellectual exercise as to how

2271
01:44:58,630 --> 01:44:59,660
that was implemented.

2272
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,600
And we won't do the
entire thing in detail,

2273
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:04,175
because I will say back in
the day when I was younger,

2274
01:45:04,175 --> 01:45:06,050
I didn't necessarily
write the cleanest code.

2275
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:10,480
And in fact, if we see inside this and
we poke around the bottom of the screen

2276
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,530
here, you can see all
of my different sprites.

2277
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:14,570
And the code is kind of complex.

2278
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:16,430
Like, things just kind
of escalated quickly.

2279
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:19,090
But I did not set out and
write all of these programs

2280
01:45:19,090 --> 01:45:20,630
all at once for each sprite.

2281
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:22,910
I pretty much took baby
steps, so to speak.

2282
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:27,220
And so, for instance, let me open up
just a few sample building blocks here

2283
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:29,690
that speak to this that
are written in advance.

2284
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:31,040
So here's version zero.

2285
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,350
Computer scientists typically
start counting at zero.

2286
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:37,430
And let me show you this example here
that only has two sprites on the screen.

2287
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:40,890
We have Oscar the trashcan and
we have the piece of trash.

2288
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:43,680
And now notice, what does Oscar do?

2289
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:47,940
Well, let me go ahead and zoom in
on this script, as it's called.

2290
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:49,290
A program is a script.

2291
01:45:49,290 --> 01:45:53,160
When the green flag is clicked, Oscar
switches his costume to Oscar one.

2292
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:55,620
That's his default costume
where the lid is closed.

2293
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:57,870
Then Oscar does this forever.

2294
01:45:57,870 --> 01:46:03,390
If Oscar is touching the mouse pointer,
change the costume to Oscar two,

2295
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:05,880
otherwise change it back to Oscar one.

2296
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:09,050
So that whole idea of animation
where Oscar is popping in and out

2297
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:11,360
is just like a quick
costume change based

2298
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,200
on a loop inside of which is a
conditional waiting for the cursor,

2299
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,000
like Anna did, to get
near the trash can.

2300
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,790
Meanwhile, if we look at
the piece of trash here,

2301
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:24,590
notice that the trash is actually not
doing anything in this first version

2302
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:27,000
because I didn't even
implement falling first.

2303
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,410
So let me hit the green flag.

2304
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:30,750
Nothing is happening in
this very first version.

2305
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:35,070
But notice, if I click on the trash
and drag as soon as I'm touching Oscar,

2306
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:37,650
there comes that trash can lid.

2307
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:42,280
And it was just the result of making
this one program respond to that input.

2308
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:42,780
All right.

2309
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:43,950
What did I do next?

2310
01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:47,400
Well, next, after taking that single
baby step, I added one other feature.

2311
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,490
Let's see inside this version one.

2312
01:46:49,490 --> 01:46:52,050
Again, Oscar is behaving
the exact same way.

2313
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:55,890
But notice this time the trash
is designed to do the following.

2314
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:59,340
First, I'm telling the program
that the drag mode is draggable.

2315
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:02,730
That is, I want the trash to be
movable when the user clicks on it.

2316
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:06,410
Then I tell the piece of trash
to go to a random x location.

2317
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:10,860
x is the horizontal, so it's
going somewhere between 0 and 240,

2318
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:12,720
but all the way at
the top of the screen.

2319
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,710
180.

2320
01:47:13,710 --> 01:47:17,310
Then forever, the piece of trash
just changes by negative one.

2321
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:19,428
So it just moves down and down and down.

2322
01:47:19,428 --> 01:47:22,220
And without looking at the second
script yet, let me just hit play.

2323
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:25,450
And notice, without even doing
anything-- and eventually,

2324
01:47:25,450 --> 01:47:27,200
once there was lots
of trash falling, like

2325
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,908
Anna was struggling
to keep up with this.

2326
01:47:28,908 --> 01:47:33,170
It's just moving one pixel at a
time forever until, thankfully, MIT

2327
01:47:33,170 --> 01:47:37,207
does stop things automatically if they
hit the bottom, lest a six-year-old get

2328
01:47:37,207 --> 01:47:39,540
upset that all of a sudden
their sprite is gone forever.

2329
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:41,700
So there is some special casing there.

2330
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:44,280
But what else is this trash doing?

2331
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:45,740
Let me zoom in here.

2332
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:49,710
The piece of trash also, when
the green flag is clicked,

2333
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:51,750
is forever asking this question.

2334
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:57,590
If you are touching Oscar, then pick a
new random location between 0 and 240

2335
01:47:57,590 --> 01:48:00,600
at positive 180 and go back to the top.

2336
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,020
So in other words, as soon
as this piece of trash

2337
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:08,250
is dragged over to Oscar like this and I
let go, it recreates itself at the top.

2338
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:12,368
It's just sort of teleporting to the
top, and thus was born this feature.

2339
01:48:12,368 --> 01:48:14,910
And I won't slog through all of
the individual features here,

2340
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:18,590
but if we do just one more and see
inside this one-- so now let me go ahead

2341
01:48:18,590 --> 01:48:19,440
and hit Play.

2342
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,890
Notice at the top left of
the screen, there's a score.

2343
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:23,100
Currently zero.

2344
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,710
But now when I click
the trash and let go,

2345
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:28,230
notice that the score is
being incremented by one.

2346
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:30,230
And this, in fact, is
how, Anna, your score kept

2347
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:31,700
going higher and higher and higher.

2348
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:35,790
Every time I noticed, oh, the trash is
touching Oscar, let's not only teleport,

2349
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:37,560
let's also increment a variable.

2350
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:42,090
And we didn't see this before, but
if I go to this Oscar Scratch now,

2351
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:44,310
you'll see that it is exactly the same.

2352
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:50,730
But if I now go to the trash piece here
and we go to when green flag clicked,

2353
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:54,990
you'll see that I'm initializing a
variable in orange called score to zero.

2354
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:57,920
But if we scroll down
to the bottom, Oscar

2355
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:00,960
is also doing another thing
in parallel at the same time.

2356
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,800
When the green flag is clicked,
Oscar is forever checking,

2357
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:07,940
is the piece of trash touching Oscar?

2358
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:11,970
If so, change the score
by one and then go to top,

2359
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:14,345
which is another location
on there, that screen.

2360
01:49:14,345 --> 01:49:16,970
So in other words, even though
at a glance something like Oscar

2361
01:49:16,970 --> 01:49:20,070
time might look very complicated
and it did take me hours,

2362
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:21,930
the goal, especially
with problem set zero,

2363
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:24,360
is not going to be to bite
off all of that at once,

2364
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,340
but to take proverbial baby steps.

2365
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:29,900
Implement one tiny feature so that
you feel like you're making progress.

2366
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:31,440
Add another feature, another.

2367
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,590
And invariably you might
run out of time and not

2368
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:36,765
get to the best version of your
vision, but hopefully it'll be good.

2369
01:49:36,765 --> 01:49:39,890
Hopefully it'll be better, but you'll
have these sort of mental milestones,

2370
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:41,682
hoping that you at
least get to that point.

2371
01:49:41,682 --> 01:49:45,250
Because as you will soon discover,
everything in the world of programming

2372
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:48,170
unfortunately takes longer
than you might expect.

2373
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:52,430
That was true for me 25 years
ago and is still true today.

2374
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:55,430
Well, let me introduce one
final set of examples here.

2375
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:58,760
This one written by one of your
own predecessors, a former student.

2376
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:02,810
Let me go ahead and open up
three baby steps, if you will,

2377
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:07,420
toward an end of implementing a game
called Ivy's Hardest Game, whereby

2378
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:10,160
it's now more interactive,
quite like Oscartime.

2379
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,430
So at top right here,
notice-- and I'll zoom

2380
01:50:12,430 --> 01:50:15,250
in-- we have this world
that's initially very simple.

2381
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:19,460
Two black lines, two walls, if you will,
and a Harvard sprite in the middle.

2382
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:21,880
But when you click
the green flag, notice

2383
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:25,280
that nothing happens initially except
that the sprite jumps to the middle.

2384
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:30,860
But I can hit the up key or the down
key or the left key or the right key.

2385
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:34,910
But if I try to go too far, even
though it's not the edge of the world,

2386
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:39,060
it's only touching that there black
line, it's still going to stop as well.

2387
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:42,420
So intuitively, how could you
implement that type of program?

2388
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:47,370
How could you get a sprite from what
we've seen to respond to up, down, left,

2389
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:51,727
right, but actually move
when I touch my arrow keys?

2390
01:50:51,727 --> 01:50:53,060
Like, what does it mean to move?

2391
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:54,060
Yeah?

2392
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:55,665
AUDIENCE: Maybe if then.

2393
01:50:55,665 --> 01:50:56,540
DAVID MALAN: Exactly.

2394
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:59,290
So much like with representing
information, at the end of the day,

2395
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:00,750
all we've got is zeros and ones.

2396
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:02,760
When it comes to
algorithms, at the moment,

2397
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:06,080
all we have are functions
and loops and conditionals

2398
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,700
and Boolean expressions and
soon some more things too.

2399
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:11,250
But there's not all that
much we have at our disposal.

2400
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:14,120
So let me zoom out from this
and let me actually show you

2401
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,080
what the Harvard sprite is doing.

2402
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,120
It's doing this.

2403
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:21,210
When I go up to the green flag here,
the Harvard sprite is going to 0, 0.

2404
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:22,440
So dead center in the middle.

2405
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:25,790
And then it's forever doing two
things, listening for the keyboard

2406
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:27,997
and feeling for walls, left and right.

2407
01:51:27,997 --> 01:51:30,330
Now, those are not puzzle
pieces that come with Scratch.

2408
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:35,520
I created my own custom blocks, my own
functions to implement those ideas.

2409
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,167
Let's not abstract away for now.

2410
01:51:37,167 --> 01:51:38,750
Let's actually look at these features.

2411
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:41,220
And indeed, to your
instincts at left here,

2412
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:43,170
what does it mean to
listen for the keyboard?

2413
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:47,630
Well, if the up arrow key
is pressed, change y by one.

2414
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:48,420
Move up.

2415
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:52,830
If the down arrow key is pressed,
change y by negative one.

2416
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:55,990
If the right arrow key is
pressed, change x by one.

2417
01:51:55,990 --> 01:51:59,620
If the left arrow key is pressed,
change x by negative one.

2418
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:01,890
So take all the magic
out of moving up, down,

2419
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:05,650
left, right by just quantizing it
as plus, minus, this, and that.

2420
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:07,780
It's all numbers, indeed,
at the end of the day.

2421
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:09,340
But what else is it doing?

2422
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:11,740
Notice that it did, indeed,
bounce off the wall.

2423
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:14,020
So my other custom
function, which I chose,

2424
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:17,920
feel for walls to evoke this
idea, it's asking two questions.

2425
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,580
If you're touching the left
wall, then change x by one,

2426
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:23,050
so bounce in the other direction.

2427
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:27,160
Else if you're touching the right wall,
bounce in the negative one direction.

2428
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:30,247
And so what are left
wall and right wall?

2429
01:52:30,247 --> 01:52:31,330
I mean, I kind of cheated.

2430
01:52:31,330 --> 01:52:32,770
I just used two more sprites.

2431
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:35,860
These sprites are literally
nothing except black lines.

2432
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:40,270
But because they exist, I can ask that
question in my conditional saying,

2433
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:42,610
are you touching those other sprites?

2434
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:46,200
And I could have colored them any way I
want, but this is enough, if I zoom in,

2435
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,350
to implement this idea of going
up, down, left, and right,

2436
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:53,810
and preventing the sprite from
leaving that little world.

2437
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:54,310
All right.

2438
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:58,000
So if you'll agree that there's
a way now to implement motion up,

2439
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,660
down, left, right, let's go
ahead and implement this idea

2440
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:03,490
by adding a rival into the
mix, like a Yale sprite.

2441
01:53:03,490 --> 01:53:07,207
And what the Yale sprite is going to
do, if I click the green flag, is this.

2442
01:53:07,207 --> 01:53:10,290
So Harvard at the moment is still going
to be movable with the arrow keys,

2443
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:11,660
up, down, left, right.

2444
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:13,410
But Yale, for better
or for worse, is just

2445
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:16,690
going to mindlessly bounce back and
forth from left to right forever,

2446
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:17,290
it would seem.

2447
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:18,665
The operative word being forever.

2448
01:53:18,665 --> 01:53:19,660
So how is that working?

2449
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:20,410
Well, let's look.

2450
01:53:20,410 --> 01:53:22,410
Here's the Yale sprite at the bottom.

2451
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:25,240
Let's zoom in on its actual code here.

2452
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:27,550
The Yale sprite starts at 0, 0.

2453
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:31,270
It points in direction 90 degrees,
which means left, right, essentially.

2454
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:32,880
And then it forever does this.

2455
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:38,260
If touching the left wall or touching
the right wall, turn around 180 degrees.

2456
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:40,590
So I don't want the
Yale sprite to just stop

2457
01:53:40,590 --> 01:53:43,240
by moving it one pixel
to bounce off slightly.

2458
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:47,380
I want it to wrap around and just keep
going and going and going forever.

2459
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:48,220
And that's it.

2460
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:49,540
Everything else is the same.

2461
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:50,770
So one final flourish.

2462
01:53:50,770 --> 01:53:54,700
Let's add a more formidable
adversary, like MIT here,

2463
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:57,060
whereby if I zoom in
and hit play, notice

2464
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:01,535
that if I move the Harvard
sprite, MIT comes chasing me now.

2465
01:54:01,535 --> 01:54:03,217
Now, how is this actually working?

2466
01:54:03,217 --> 01:54:05,800
Yale is just kind of doing its
thing, bouncing back and forth.

2467
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:10,630
Now MIT has really latched on to me and
it's following me up, down, left, right.

2468
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:12,215
So how is that logic now working?

2469
01:54:12,215 --> 01:54:14,340
Well, again, it's probably
doing something forever,

2470
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:16,270
because that's why it's
continually doing it.

2471
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:17,580
Let's click on MIT.

2472
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:21,010
This too is pretty simple, even
though it's a pretty fancy idea.

2473
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:24,340
Initially the MIT sprite
goes to a random position,

2474
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:28,140
but thereafter, it forever points
toward the Harvard logo outline, which

2475
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:30,810
is just the long name that your
predecessor or former student

2476
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:32,890
gave the name for that sprite.

2477
01:54:32,890 --> 01:54:35,980
And then it moves one
step, one step, one step.

2478
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:38,580
So suppose this were an actual
game, and in games things

2479
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:41,410
get harder and harder, the
adversary moves faster and faster.

2480
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:46,040
How could we make MIT even faster
by changing just one thing here?

2481
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,610


2482
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:51,070
Like, how do we level up?

2483
01:54:51,070 --> 01:54:54,740
Change the one to two pixels
at a time, two steps at a time.

2484
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:55,490
So let's see that.

2485
01:54:55,490 --> 01:54:56,657
Let's go ahead and zoom out.

2486
01:54:56,657 --> 01:54:57,440
Let's hit play.

2487
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:01,380
And now notice that MIT is
coming in much faster this time.

2488
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:01,880
All right.

2489
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:04,057
So it wasn't noticeably faster.

2490
01:55:04,057 --> 01:55:04,640
Let's do this.

2491
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,170
Let's move 10 steps at a time.

2492
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:08,200
So 10 steps faster than originally.

2493
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:12,530
I mean, now-- and now notice it's kind
of twitching back and forth in this way.

2494
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:13,030
Why?

2495
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:15,280
Well, probably, if we worked
out the math, probably

2496
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:18,437
the MIT sprite is touching the
sprite and it's bouncing off of it,

2497
01:55:18,437 --> 01:55:20,270
but then it's realizing,
oh, I went too far.

2498
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:20,990
Let me move back.

2499
01:55:20,990 --> 01:55:21,410
Wait a minute.

2500
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:22,130
I'm still touching it.

2501
01:55:22,130 --> 01:55:22,940
Let me move down.

2502
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:24,815
So you can get into
these perverse situations

2503
01:55:24,815 --> 01:55:27,582
where there is actually a bug,
be it logical or aesthetical.

2504
01:55:27,582 --> 01:55:29,540
But in this case, we
probably want to fix that.

2505
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:32,840
So 10 is probably too fast for
this to work particularly well.

2506
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:37,300
But the final flourish here really is
to show you the actual version of a game

2507
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:40,780
that one of your predecessors, a
past classmate, actually implemented.

2508
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:43,150
Before, thereafter, we
will adjourn for cake

2509
01:55:43,150 --> 01:55:45,410
in the transept, which
is the CS50 tradition.

2510
01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:49,090
But can we get one more
final volunteer to come on

2511
01:55:49,090 --> 01:55:51,648
up to play Ivy's Hardest Game?

2512
01:55:51,648 --> 01:55:53,690
I'm seeing your hand most
enthusiastically there.

2513
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:54,960
Yeah, come on down.

2514
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,340

In just a moment, we
will indeed adjourn.

But the goal here now is going
to be to navigate a maze that's

2519
01:56:06,670 --> 01:56:09,100
a little more difficult than the last.

01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:13,017

yourselves to your classmates in front.

Eric, go ahead and
take the keyboard here.

01:56:24,230 --> 01:56:26,563
It, too, will be all about
up, down, left, right as soon

You Can't touch this

2536
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,990
DAVID MALAN: So notice, the black
walls are a little more involved

2537
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:38,005
than last time.

2538
01:56:38,005 --> 01:56:40,380
But the goal is to get to the
sprite all the way at right

2539
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:44,070
and just touch it, at which
point you move to the next level.

2540
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:49,170
The next level, of course, has Yale
doing its thing back and forth.

2541
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:51,060
You've made it to level three.

2542
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,540
But now there's two Yale.

2543
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:55,560

the mix that's randomly
